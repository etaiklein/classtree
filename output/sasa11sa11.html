<h2>Assignment</h2>
<p>This assignment will help you learn about backtracking</p></body></html>.

<p>The 8-queens problems asks us to place 8 queens on a chessboard so
that no two can capture one another; that is, no two are on the same
row, column, or diagonal.  One solution (figure from Wikipedia) is:</p>
<img alt="8 queens on a chess board" src="8Queens.jpg">
<p>We can generalize 8-queens to <i>n</i>-queens, where the board is
<i>n</i> x <i>n</i>, and we are to place <i>n</i> queens.</p>
<p>As we discussed in class, simply generating all possible queen placements and testing
each of them for validity is not practical, since there are just too
many possibilities.  Instead, at each step we consider all possible
choices for a given column, and recursively solve the rest of the puzzle for each
<em>feasible</em> choice.  The important point is that if a given
choice is not feasible (because it somehow conflicts with earlier
choices), that choice should be <em>pruned</em>.</p>
<h2>Basic solver</h2>
<p>Write a method that, given a number <tt>n</tt> creates a list of all valid
placements of <tt>n</tt> queens on an <tt>n</tt> x <tt>n</tt>
chessboard so that no two lie on in the same row, column, or diagonal.
You should employ a recursive backtracking algorithm to do so.</p>
<p>A solution should be represented as an array, where the k<sup>th</sup>
position in the array
contains the position of the queen in the k<sup>th</sup> <em>column</em>.
The values indicate which <em>row</em>
(among 1 through <tt>n</tt>) in that column has a queen.  Thus the array
<tt>{2,4,6,8,3,1,7,5}</tt> represents the solution shown above
(listing columns left to right and counting rows bottom to top).</p>
<p>Your program should create a list of all possible solutions.  For
example, when n = 6, your program should return:</p>
<code>[{2,4,6,1,3,5},
 {3,6,2,5,1,4},
 {4,1,5,2,6,3},
 {5,3,1,6,4,2}]</code>.</img>
<p>You should construct the lists column by column.  For each column
try all values from 1 to
<i>n</i> for the <i>k</i>th queen and eliminate those that are
invalid before calling your function recursively to place the rest of the queens.
When there are no more queens to be placed your array of partial
placements a solution.  Make a <b>copy</b> of the array and save it in
your solution list.  If your array is <code>arr</code>, then 
<code>arr.clone()</code> will make a copy of the array.</p>

<h2>Driver</h2>
<p>
Write a driver (i.e., the main method) to test your solver.
The driver should repeatedly prompt the user to enter <code>n</code>
and, if n &gt; 8, print only the number of solutions; if n &lt;= 8, print the number of solutions
as well as the solutions themselves.
When the user enters a non-positive number in response to the prompt for <code>n</code>,
the program should quit.

<p>
See Section 1.6 of the text (on page 38) to review how to read input from the keyboard.


<h2>Extra Credit - Eliminate symmetries</h2>
<p>Note that the four solutions to the 6-queen problem, given above,
are not really different: the first and fourth are mirror images of
each other left to right, as are the second and the third (the lists
are reversals of each other).  For this problem, you are to take the
output from the first problem and create a list of solutions, no two
of which are symmetrical.  There are multiple symmetries here that you
must detect: reflections along either a vertical line, a horizontal
line, or a diagonal line (either diagonal), as well as rotations by
90, 180, or 270 degrees.</p>
<p>Detecting reflections vertically or horizontally is easy.
Detecting diagonal reflections is a bit harder.  Detecting rotations
is hardest.  For detecting diagonals and rotations it may be easiest
to convert your list of column values to a list of (row, column)
pairs.  If you stare at it enough, you'll even see that rotations can
be generated by composing other symmetries (though a direct
implementation is fine).</p>
<h2>Canvas submission</h2>
<p>Submit via Canvas: 
<ol>
<li>your code.</li>
<li>screenshots (or copied text file) of test runs showing all solutions 
  for n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, plus the number of solutions for each.
  The number is simply the length of the list that you create.</li>
<li>screenshots (or copied text file) showing the number of solutions for 
  n = 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.  Note that you should <em>not</em> print all of the solutions, only the 
  number of solutions.</li>
</ol>
