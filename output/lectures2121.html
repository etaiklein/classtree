<h2 id="backtracking">Backtracking</h2>
<p>Sometimes instead of finding a single path or a single solution we want to find all solutions. A systematic way of doing this is called <strong>backtracking</strong>. It is a variant of depth-first search on an implicit graph. The typical approach uses recursion. At every choice point, loop through all the choices. For each choice, solve the problem recursively. Succeed if you find a solution; otherwise fail and backtrack to try an alternative.</p>
<h3 id="n-queens"><span class="math"><em>N</em></span>-queens</h3>
<p>Let's consider the <strong><span class="math"><em>N</em></span>-queens problem</strong>. The goal is to place <span class="math"><em>N</em></span> queens on an <span class="math"><em>N</em> × <em>N</em></span> chessboard such that no two queens can capture one another. (Two queens can capture one another if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal.)</p>
<p>A truly brutish brute-force solution technique would be to consider <em>all</em> possible ways of placing <span class="math"><em>N</em></span> queens on the board, and then checking each configuration. This technique is truly awful, because for an <span class="math"><em>N</em> × <em>N</em></span> board, there are <span class="math"><em>N</em><sup>2</sup></span> squares and hence <span class="math">$N^2 \atopwithdelims() N$</span> possible configurations. That's the number of ways to choose <span class="math"><em>N</em></span> items (squares) out of <span class="math"><em>N</em><sup>2</sup></span>, and it's equal to <span class="math">$\displaystyle \frac{N^2!}{N!(N^2-N)!}$</span>. For an <span class="math">8 × 8</span> board, where <span class="math"><em>N</em> = 8</span>, that comes to 4,426,165,368 configurations.</p>
<p>Another, less brutish, brute-force solution takes advantage of the property that we must have exactly one queen per column. So we can just try all combinations of queens, as long as there's one per column. There are <span class="math"><em>N</em></span> ways to put a queen in column 1, <span class="math"><em>N</em></span> ways to put a queen in column 2, and so on, for a total of <span class="math"><em>N</em><sup><em>N</em></sup></span> configurations to check. When <span class="math"><em>N</em> = 8</span>, we have reduced the number of configurations to 16,777,216.</p>
<p>We can make our brute-force solution a little better yet. Since no two queens can be in the same row, we can just try all permutations of 1 through <span class="math"><em>N</em></span>, saying that the first number is the row number for column 1, the second number is the row number for column 2, and so on. Now there are "only" <span class="math"><em>N</em>!</span> configurations, which is 40,320 for <span class="math"><em>N</em> = 8</span>. Of course, for a larger board, <span class="math"><em>N</em>!</span> can be mighty large. In fact, once we get to <span class="math"><em>N</em> = 13</span>, we get that <span class="math"><em>N</em>!</span> equals 6,227,020,800, and so things are worse than the most brutish brute-force solution for <span class="math"><em>N</em> = 8</span>.</p>
<p>So let's be a little smarter. Rather than just blasting out configurations, let's pay attention to what we've done. Start by placing a queen in column 1, row 1. Now we <em>know</em> that we cannot put a queen in column 2, row 1, because the two queens would be in the same row. We also cannot put a queen in column 2, row 2, because the queens would be on the same diagonal. So we place a queen in column 2, row 3. Now we move onto column 3. We cannot put the queen in any of rows 1–4 (think about why not), and so we put the queen in row 5. And so on.</p>
<p>This approach is called <strong>pruning</strong>. At the <span class="math"><em>k</em></span>th step, we try to extend the partial solution with <span class="math"><em>k</em> − 1</span> queens by adding a queen in the <span class="math"><em>k</em></span>th column in all possible positions. But "possible" now means positions that don't conflict with earlier queen placements. It may be that no choices are possible. In that case, the partial solution cannot be extended. In other words, it's infeasible. And so we backtrack, undoing some choices and trying others.</p>
<p>Why do we call this approach pruning? Because you can view the search as a tree in which the path from the root to any node in the tree represents a partial solution, making a particular choice at each step. When we reject an invalid partial solution, we are lopping off its node <em>and the entire subtree that would go below it</em>, so that we have "pruned" the search tree. Early pruning lops off large subtrees. Effort spent pruning usually (but not always) pays off in the end, because of the exponential growth in number of solutions considered each time a choice is made.</p>
<p>Go through the backtracking for <span class="math"><em>N</em> = 4</span>:
<p>Here is one solution for <span class="math"><em>N</em> = 8</span>, taken from Wikipedia:</p>

<h3>Instant Insanity</h3>
<p>We consider the puzzle called Instant Insanity.  It came out well
before Rubic's Cube and other really difficult puzzles.  The puzzle has
four cubes.  For each cube each of its six sides is colored red, blue,
green, or white.  (Show the puzzle.)  The puzzle is to make a tower 
of the cubes by stacking them one on top of another in a way that
each side of the tower has each color appearing once.</p>
<p>We use an object-oriented approach to the puzzle.  We want an
object type <a href="Cube.java"><code>Cube</code></a>
to hold an individual cube.  It holds the colors of the six faces
in instance variables, and allows us to rotate the cube, tip it 
90 degrees around the front-back axis so that the top becomes the left
face, and to flip it around the same axis so that the top becomes the
bottm.</p>
<p>Much of the work is done in the class 
<a href="CubeTower.java"><code>CubeTower</code></a>.  This object
contains all four cubes.  It supplies methods to rotate, flip, and 
tip particular cubes and a validity test to see if there are any 
conflicts.</p>
<p>The program <a href="Insane1.java"><code>Insane1</code></a>
is a really stupid, brute-force way to solve the puzzle.  It is clever 
enough to note that flipping each piece simultaneously will give another
solution and that rotating the tower, starting with either the original solution 
or the flipped solution, will give four solutions each.  Therefore it only
places the bottom cube in three positions, one for each top-bottom pair.</p>
<p>The other cubes are each placed in 24 positions. (4 rotations, 
flip, 4 rotations, flip back, rotate and tip. Repeat three times.  This actually
gets you back to where you started.)  There is no pruning.
Only when all 4 cubes are placed do we check for validity.  This results
in 43,276 calls to <code>placeCube</code>.  Not bad for a computer, but slow by hand.
(Thirty years ago it took a while even on a computer).</p>
<p><a href="Insane2.java"><code>Insane2</code></a> has the sense to 
check for validity of the first k placements before proceeding to placement
k+1.  This improves things a whole lot.  It results in 1347 validity tests and
58 calls to <code>placeCube</code>.  This is not unreasonable to do by hand,
and takes virtually no time on a computer.</p>
<p><a href="Insane3.java"><code>Insane3</code></a> adds additional pruning.
The idea is that there are partial solutions that have no conflicts on their sides that still
cannot be extended to a complete solution.  We would like to prune these, also.  
Whenever we place a cube we "bury" its top color and its bottom color, in the sense
that they are no longer available to appear on the sides. If we bury enough occurrances
of a color there will not be 4 copies of that color to appear on all four sides of the
tower, so the partial solution cannot be extended to a complete solution.  
<a href="Insane3.java"><code>Insane3</code></a> uses the object 
<a href="BuriedCount.java"><code>BuriedCount</code></a> to keep track of
how many of each color have been buried and whether a solution might still be possible.
It allows us to bury and unbury particular colors.
<a href="CubeTower.java"><code>CubeTower</code></a> has methods to bury and 
unbury the top and bottom faces of a cube and to ask <code>BuriedCount</code> 
whether a solution is still possible.  This reduces the number
of validity tests to 379 and the number of calls to <code>placeCube</code> to 37.  For
36 of these calls we bury, unbury, and test whether we have buried too much three times.
This is practical to do by hand.</p>
<p>Note - The idea of this backtracking is simple, but the details of how the cubes are placed and rotated gets complicated.  The N-queens backtracking is <em>much</em> simpler.  You should not be creating new classes or using data structures beyond an <code>ArrayList</code> and some arrays.

<h2>Applications with GUIs</h2>
<p>The Maze program is an application, but it has a GUI.
So far only applets have used GUIs. It also uses radio buttons,
a concept that we have not seen yet.  We will now see how to create
applications with GUIs as well, and will look at a few more of the
dozens of specialized components that are in Swing.  Fortunately
they all use the same basic way of communicating with your program
(listeners), so once you have seen a few it is not hard to pick up
new ones as you need them.</p>
<p>In a GUI for an application instead of an Applet window we use a
<strong>frame</strong>.  A frame has title bar (including a close box,
which we will deal with, and the usual collection of other control
boxes, which we will let Java deal with), and a content pane.  (It
also has other things that we don't need to worry about.)

<p>

The first task is to get the frame displayed, and to get it to go away
when we click the "close" box.  The main program creates the frame,
<em>but even after the main program is done the frame continues to
run.</em> That's because when we open a frame window, the program
starts a new <strong>thread of execution</strong> that displays the
GUI.  When the <code>main</code> method completes, its <em>main
thread</em> is done, but the thread for the GUI is still running.
Therefore, we need a way to stop the program when the close box is
clicked.

<p>

We stop the program as in <a href="Fahrenheit.java">Fahrenheit.java</a> and <a href="FahrenheitGUI.java">FahrenheitGUI.java</a>.  We have seen most
of the GUI components—<code>JPanel</code>, <code>JLabel</code>,
and <code>JTextField</code>—before.  What's new is the
<code>JFrame</code>.  In this example, the <code>FahrenheitGUI</code>
object creates a new <code>JFrame</code> and sets the instance
variable <code>frame</code> to reference it.  The constructor includes
the string <code>Temperature Conversion</code> that is displayed in
the frame's title bar.

<p>

The way that we indicate that the program gets stopped is with the
line
<xmp>
frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
</xmp>

The <code>setDefaultCloseOperation</code> says what should happen when
the frame's close button is clicked.  Here, we specify that the
program should exit, or terminate.

<p>

In this example, the <code>display</code> method of
<code>FahrenheitGUI</code> calls <code>frame.pack</code> and
<code>frame.setVisible(true)</code>.  The <code>pack</code> method
sizes the frame to fit the components that have been added into it,
and the <code>setVisible</code> method with a parameter of
<code>true</code> tells the frame to actually display itself on the
screen.  You should call <code>pack</code> on a <code>JFrame</code>
if the <code>setSize</code> method has not been called on the
<code>JFrame</code> to set its size.  In this example, we have called
<code>setPreferredSize</code> on a <code>JPanel</code> that is added
to the <code>JFrame</code>, but we have not called
<code>setSize</code> on the <code>JFrame</code> itself.  The
<code>pack</code> method of <code>JFrame</code> has the
<code>JFrame</code> set its size to fit around the GUI components
within the frame.

<h3>More about frames</h3>

It is considered bad form to draw directly on the frame, because the
frame is used to lay out buttons, text fields, etc., and if you draw
directly on the frame, the Swing methods won't know to avoid the areas
where you have placed other GUI components.  Recall that the same
holds for applets.  With applications, we will
again use the <code>JPanel</code> both for drawing and as a container
for grouping buttons, check boxes, or other components together.  We
will add <code>JPanel</code> objects to a frame or to another
container.  You can build a whole hierarchy of components by
assembling <code>JPanel</code>s, getting a lot of control over the
layout.  When components are added to a <code>JPanel</code> they use a
Flow Layout by default.  We'll see later how to use a different layout
manager for a <code>JPanel</code>.

<p>

As with the <code>JApplet</code> objects we saw earlier, we do not add
components directly to a <code>JFrame</code>.  A frame has a number of
panes, one of which is the content pane.  Therefore when adding
components to a frame, we write
<xmp>
Container contentPane = getContentPane();
</xmp>
and then add components to the <code>contentPane</code>.  Or, as in
the constructor for <code>FahrenheitGUI</code>, we don't bother
storing the result of <code>getContentPane</code> in a variable.

<p>

The content pane of an application uses a different layout scheme
called <strong>Border Layout</strong>.  We saw this before in PS-3,
although we did not require you to program with it. The pane is partitioned into
five regions: North, South, East, West, and Center.  They appear in
the pane as follows:

<p>
<center>
<img src="BorderLayout.GIF">
</img></center>
<p>

You can add at most one component to any one of these regions.
Regions with no component are taken over by the Center region, which
expands to fill the leftover area.  We'll see that the North and South
regions expand horizontally in ways that are sometimes a bit strange.

<p>

We can arrange the layout of a GUI using the content pane and as many
<code>JPanel</code>s as we like.

<a name="buttontest"></a>
<h2><code>ButtonTest.java</code></h2>

Let's look at an application that uses
multiple <code>JPanel</code> objects: the program <a href="ButtonTest.java">ButtonTest.java</a>.  When running it, we can
see that it has four buttons across the bottom and a large content
pane where a rectangle can be moved via button clicks.  Try it out.
We will see how to set up this GUI.

<p>

First, consider the <code>main</code> program.  It is similar to the
frame example we looked at earlier.  The only differences are that it
uses <code>frame.setTitle</code> to set the title here rather than
doing it in the frame's constructor, and we call <code>setSize</code>
on the frame, thus obviating the need to call <code>pack</code>.

<p>

The real work of setting up the GUI is in <a href="ButtonFrame.java">ButtonFrame.java</a>.  The
<code>ButtonFrame</code> class has five private instance variables:
<ul>
<li> four <code>JButton</code>s to hold the buttons, and

  <li> a <code>RectanglePanel</code>, which inherits from
       <code>JPanel</code>.  This is a panel on which we draw the
       moving rectangle.

</li></li></ul>
<p>

In the constructor for <code>ButtonFrame</code>, we make sure that the
program will stop when the window is closed by calling
<code>setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE)</code>.

<p>

The <code>ButtonFrame</code>constructor then assigns the instance
variable <code>rectPanel</code> to a new <code>RectanglePanel</code>.
It also creates the <code>JPanel buttonPanel</code> to group the
buttons together.  This variable is local, because we do not need it
after the constructor is done.  The buttons themselves are needed
after the constructor finishes, but the panel that groups them is not.

<p>

All four buttons are created, with labels <code>Up</code>,
<code>Down</code>, <code>Left</code>, and <code>Right</code>.  Unlike
the GUI in Lab Assignment 3, all four buttons are assigned the same
listener object.  We will see later how we can do different things in
the method, depending on which button was pushed.

<p>

All we have done so far is create some objects.  We have yet to place
them into the frame.  That's what happens next.  The program gets the
<code>contentPane</code> from the frame and adds
<code>rectPanel</code>, the drawing area, to the center region of the
<code>contentPane</code> using the builtin constant
<code>BorderLayout.CENTER</code>.  (Alternatively, you can instead use
the string <code>"Center"</code> as the second parameter to
<code>add</code>.)

<p>

We want all four buttons in the South area of the frame.  With the
variable <code>layoutStyle</code> set to the value
<code>flowLayout</code> (from the enumerated type
<code>LayoutType</code>), we first add all four to the 
<code>JFrame buttonPanel</code> (using Flow Layout) and then add
<code>buttonPanel</code> to the south part of the
<code>contentPane</code>.

<p>

The method <code>actionPerformed</code> in
<code>DirectionListener</code> responds to the button clicks.  The
<code>ActionEvent event</code> has within it a reference to the object
that is the source of the event.  A call to
<code>event.getSource</code> returns this reference.  By comparing
<em>references</em> we can decide which button was clicked in a series
of if-else statements.  Then each of them moves the rectangle in the
<code>rectPanel</code> in a different direction by calling the
<code>moveRectangle</code> method of <code>RectanglePanel</code> with
the appropriate parameter values.  After moving the rectangle,
<code>actionPerformed</code> has the <code>RectanglePanel</code> draw
itself.

<p>

What remains is the <code>RectanglePanel</code> class in <a href="RectanglePanel.java">RectanglePanel.java</a>.  This is the panel
for the drawing area.  Therefore it has the methods to deal with
drawing on the panel (<code>paintComponent</code>) and the information
about what is to be drawn there.

<p>

It has a private instance variable <code>theRect</code>, which
references the <code>Rect</code> object to be drawn.  We've seen the
<code>Rect</code> class, in <a href="Rect.java">Rect.java</a>, before.
The rectangle is initialized in the constructor to be at the upper
left-hand corner of the panel.  Each panel has its own coordinate
system.

<p>


To draw we call <code>paintComponent</code>. 
<strong>Important note: the first line of <code>paintComponent</code>
should always be a call to <code>super.paintComponent</code>.</strong>
Doing so gives the superclass method a chance to do what it needs to
do with the panel.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></body></html>
Then it can do what we normally want.  In this case, it draws
<code>theRect</code> and then draws a grid of light grey lines in
multiples of the rectangle size.  The calls to <code>getWidth</code>
and <code>getHeight</code> are actually calling methods inherited from
<code>JPanel</code>; these calls return the width and height of the
panel, so that we draw the grey lines at the correct lengths.

<p>

Another method is <code>moveRectangle</code>.  It simply shifts the
rectangle by <code>dx</code> rectangle widths in the <i>x</i>
direction and <code>dy</code> rectangle heights in the <i>y</i>
direction.  Remember that the <code>actionPerformed</code> method
called it to move the rectangle in response to button pushes.

<p>

The last method in <code>RectanglePanel</code> is <code>draw</code>,
which just calls <code>repaint</code>.  Strictly speaking, we didn't
need to define <code>draw</code> in <code>RectanglePanel</code>.
Instead, we could have replaced the call <code>rectPanel.draw()</code>
in the <code>actionPerformed</code> method of <code>ButtonFrame</code>
by the call <code>rectPanel.repaint()</code>.  I chose to define and
call the <code>draw</code> method because it is cleaner to hide that
<code>rectPanel</code> has a <code>repaint</code> method from the
classes that use it.  In fact, just calling <code>repaint</code> here
would also work.

<h3>Using a Border Layout manager in a JPanel</h3>

The flow layout of the buttons doesn't really match the way I'd like
the buttons to be placed.  I'd like to have the <code>Up</code> button
on the top, the <code>Left</code> button on the left, the
<code>Right</code> button on the right, and the <code>Down</code>
button on the bottom.  Setting the variable <code>layoutStyle</code>
to <code>wideBorderLayout</code> gets us closer.

<p>

Now our button layout is accomplished by the lines
<xmp>
buttonPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
buttonPanel.add(upButton, BorderLayout.NORTH);
buttonPanel.add(downButton, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
buttonPanel.add(leftButton, BorderLayout.WEST);
buttonPanel.add(rightButton, BorderLayout.EAST);
</xmp>

That gives a more intuitive button layout, with the <code>Up</code>
button on the North side, the <code>Down</code> button on the South
side, the <code>Left</code> button on the West side, and the
<code>Right</code> button on the East side.  The only aesthetic
problem is that with Border Layout, the North and South borders
stretch the entire horizontal span of the panel, so that the
<code>Up</code> and <code>Down</code> buttons appear much, much wider
than the <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> buttons.

<p>

We can solve that problem, too.  If we set variable
<code>layoutStyle</code> to <code>niceBorderLayout</code>, we run the
lines
<xmp>
buttonPanel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());
JPanel northPanel = new JPanel();
northPanel.add(upButton);
JPanel southPanel = new JPanel();
southPanel.add(downButton);
buttonPanel.add(northPanel, BorderLayout.NORTH);
buttonPanel.add(southPanel, BorderLayout.SOUTH);
buttonPanel.add(leftButton, BorderLayout.WEST);
buttonPanel.add(rightButton, BorderLayout.EAST);
</xmp>
Here, we create two more <code>JPanel</code> objects, referenced by
<code>northPanel</code> and <code>southPanel</code>, each holding just
one <code>JButton</code>.  By putting <code>upButton</code> and
<code>downButton</code> each in its own little <code>JPanel</code>, we
prevent these buttons from being stretched horizontally in a Border
Layout.

<a name="choice"></a>
<h2>Text fields, check boxes, radio buttons, and combo boxes</h2>

The program <a href="ChoiceTest.java">ChoiceTest.java</a> demonstrates
four other Swing components used to make choices:
<ul>
<li> Check boxes: the <code>JCheckBox</code> class.
  <li> Radio buttons: the <code>JRadioButton</code> class.
  <li> Combo boxes: the <code>JComboBox</code> class.
</li></li></li></ul>

This program displays a sample of text, where the user gets to choose
a font (Times, a font with serifs; Helvetica, a sans-serif font; or
Courier, a monospaced font), a size (small, medium, or large), and a
style (plain, italic, bold, or bold italic).  The user may also decide
whether the text itself is editable and, if it is, may edit it.

<p>

At this point, many of the features of this program are probably
self-explanatory.  Some are not.  We'll go through a few of them here.

<p>

The heavy lifting is done in <a href="ChoiceFrame.java">ChoiceFrame.java</a>.  The
<code>ChoiceFrame</code> constructor builds the GUI.  As usual, we
attach a listener to each button or combo box.  As in the
<code>ButtonFrame</code> class in <a href="ButtonFrame.java">ButtonFrame.java</a>, we use one listener for
all choice components.  This listener's <code>actionPerformed</code>
method calls the method <code>setSampleFont</code>, which gets the
value of each choice component and then displays the sample text
according to these values.

<p>

When constructing the <code>JTextField</code> referenced by
<code>sampleField</code>, we specify a text string to display.  We
also set the editability of this text field to <code>false</code>, so
that the user cannot edit it.  The editability can be changed,
however, as we shall see.

<p>

All check boxes, from the Swing class <code>JCheckBox</code>, may be
turned on and off individually.  We use them for independent choices.
Here, we have three check boxes:
<ul>
<li> <code>editableCheckBox</code>, which the user can click to make
       the text field editable.

  <li> <code>italicCheckBox</code>, which specifies that the text is
       to be displayed in italics.

  <li> <code>boldCheckBox</code>, which specifies that the text is to
       be displayed in boldface.

</li></li></li></ul>

To determine whether a check box is checked, we use the
<code>isSelected</code> method.  The <code>setSampleFont</code> method
makes calls such as <code>editableCheckBox.isSelected()</code> and
<code>italicCheckBox.isSelected()</code>.

<p>

A combo box lets the user pick one of a list of items.  Here, the
items are font names.  When one is chosen, an action event occurs,
which is handled by the listener we attach to the combo box.  Because
we set the combo box to be editable, the user can type in other font
names, too.

<p>

We use radio buttons to select the font size: small, medium, or large.
Radio buttons allow the user to make exactly one choice out of a set
of choices.  The way we indicate each set of choices is with
<code>ButtonGroup</code> objects.  We create a new
<code>ButtonGroup</code> for each set of choices, and we add the
buttons to the <code>ButtonGroup</code>.  A <code>ButtonGroup</code>
has nothing to do with the layout of the buttons on the screen; it
makes it so that when the user clicks one button of a set, Swing knows
which other buttons have to become unselected.  (It takes care of
unselecting them.)  We choose to start out with one radio button 
being selected - if we did not none would be selected.  
Here, we choose the one for the large text size.

<p>

We can also add tool tips to our check boxes and radio buttons.  By
calling the <code>setToolTipText</code> method on a GUI component, we
give text that will appear when the cursor is held over the component.
This method applies to pretty much any GUI component, including combo
boxes.

<p>

That takes care of setting up the objects.  Next is the physical
layout.  We make a <code>JPanel</code> named <code>sampleFrame</code>,
with Border Layout, to hold <code>editableCheckBox</code> and
<code>sampleField</code>, with the check box above the text field.  By
adding <code>sampleField</code> to the center region of the Border
Layout, we make it so that when the window is resized, the sample
text's panel grows and shrinks to fit the window.  We then make a
panel for the font name combo box.  Next, a panel for the size radio
buttons.  We put the title "Size" and an etched border around this
panel.  Similarly, we make a panel for the style check boxes, with the
title "Style" and an etched border.

<p>

The latter three panels—for the font name combo box, size radio
buttons, and style radio buttons—are aligned vertically using a
new layout manager: the Box Layout manager.  A Box Layout allows us to
align components either vertically or horizontally.  Unlike the other
layout managers, a <code>BoxLayout</code> constructor takes as a
parameter a reference to the component that it is laying out.  I don't
know why.  But it means that if you were using a Box Layout to lay out
more than one component, you would have to create a new
<code>BoxLayout</code> object for each one.  Here, the component that
the Box Layout manager is working on is <code>southPanel</code>.

<p>

The two panels that we have yet to place into a
container—<code>sampleFrame</code> and
<code>southPanel</code>—are put into the content pane.  Recall
that in an application, the content panel by default uses Border
Layout.  Again, by putting the panel containing the sample text in the
center region, the sample text's panel will grow and shrink as the
window is resized.

<p>

Finally, the <code>ChoiceFrame</code> constructor calls
<code>setSampleFont</code> to get the values of all the GUI components
and redisplay the sample text.  The <code>setSampleFont</code> method
asks whether each check box and radio button is selected, doing the
appropriate thing for each component that is selected.  The call
<code>fontnameCombo.getSelectedItem()</code> returns what appears in
the combo box.  Here, we cast it to a <code>String</code>, which is
what we'll be using.

<p>

The style is an integer that we set according to the check boxes.  It
starts as a 0, indicating "plain," and we add into it according to
other styles that we want.  <code>Font.ITALIC</code> and
<code>Font.BOLD</code> are constants that indicate the styles used
here.  We set the font size according to which of the radio buttons is
selected.

<p>

Once we have the font name, style, and size, we call the
<code>setFont</code> method on <code>sampleField</code> with the font
name, style, and size.  This call changes some of the text field's
display characteristics.  A call to <code>sampleField.repaint</code>
causes the text field to actually redisplay.

<h2>The Maze Program Layout and Operation</h2>
<p>Given this we can see how the maze program is laid out. The
top level <a href="../20/MazeSolver.java">MazeSolver.java</a>
simply creates the maze frame, sets its size and title, and makes
it visible.</p>
<p>The work is done in <a href="../20/MazeFrame.java">MazeFrame.java</a>.
This sets up the frame and the buttons.  Note that the <code>stepButton</code>, 
<code>clearButton</code>,
and <code>readButton</code> are local variables.  That is because once they are
registered with a listener nothing more needs to be done with them.  The
<code>solveButton</code> has to change its text (alternates between "Solve" and
"Pause") and the radio buttons need to be tested to see which is selected.
Therefore they are instance variables. The button layouts are very similar
to ones we have seen before, so I will let you read them on your own.</p>
<p>The listeners are worth looking at.  The <code>StepListener</code> does
the work of actually performing a step in the maze.  It is used by both the
<code>Timer</code> and the <code>stepButton</code>.  If the maze is solved 
it turns off the timer and sets the label on the <code>solveButton</code> to 
Solve.  If not, it calls <code>maze.stepMaze()</code> to do one more step
in solving the maze.</p>
The <code>SolveListener</code> is
used to handle the <code>solveButton</code>.  It toggles the label on the 
button and the state of the timer (if on, then turns it off, and vise versa).
The <code>ReadListener</code> reads a new maze and creates it.  The 
<code>RadioListener</code> creates a new maze, with <code>createMaze</code>
looking at the radio buttons.  Creating a new maze is what we want to do
when we clear the maze, so this works for the <code>clearButton</code> also.</p>
</p>The <code>createMaze</code> method sets up a new maze. It creates the
correct type of sequencer.  (Remember a sequencer is basically an abstract queue -
it can add items and get the next item.)  It makes a maze from the text representation
that has been read in (or does nothing if no text has been read or it has an error).
It passes this maze on to the <code>mazeCanvas</code> and repaints.</p>
<p>The <code>mazeCanvas</code> holds a <a href="../20/MazePanel.java">MazePanel.java</a>,
which basically draws the current maze.  The code for <code>display</code> figures out
the square size and the position of the upper left hand corner, and it draws each square 
in the appropriate color.</p>
<p><a href="../20/Maze.java">Maze.java</a> both initializes the maze in its
constructor and performs a step of solving the maze in <code>stepMaze</code>. 
Method <code>stepMaze</code> is where the virutal graph is explored.  It calls the 
current sequencer to get the next
maze square to be processed.  If the square to be processed is the target it traces back the path,
marking each square as on the final path.  If not, and the square was not explored, 
it tries to add each of its four potential
neighbors to the sequencer (if they exist and are either empty or the target) and marks
the current square as explored.  This will prevent it from being explored again later.</p>
<p>The actual code for solving the maze would have been simpler if we were not creating
an interactive GUI.  The GUI requires spreading the solution out, separating out the
code for taking a step and making it act on the current "state" of the maze. This step
code would normally be part of a loop.  But here the loop is provided by the GUI, either
via the Step button or repeated calls from the Timer after clicking Solve.</p>
