<h1 id="problem-solving-via-object-oriented-programming">Problem Solving Via Object-Oriented Programming</h1>
<h2 id="about-the-course">About the course</h2>
<p>CS 10 is the second prerequisite for the Computer Science major and minor. It covers fundamental concepts 
in computer science, in two broad areas: object-oriented programming and data structures. In particular, 
we'll use object-oriented programming to implement data structures. We'll understand why the data structures 
work and analyze their efficiency. We'll also lean heavily on abstraction, so that we can separate the 
<em>what</em> from the <em>how</em>.</p>
<p>Now, data structures can be cool on their own, but they're even better when we apply them to solve 
interesting problems. That's what we do in CS 10.</p>
<p>Here's the ORC description of the course:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Motivated by problems that arise in a variety of disciplines, this course examines concepts and develops 
skills in solving computational problems. Topics covered include abstraction (how to hide details), modularity 
(how to decompose problems), data structures (how to efficiently organize data), and algorithms (procedures 
for solving problems). Laboratory assignments are implemented using object-oriented programming techniques.</p>

<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>In order for you to take this course, you must have fulfilled one of the following prerequisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Taken Computer Science 1 (or the old CS 5)</li>
<li>Taken Engineering Sciences 20</li>
<li>Taken the Computer Science A AP Exam and gotten a 4 or 5</li>
<li>Passed the department's placement exam</li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not have any of the above prerequisites, you should see Professor Drysdale as soon as possible.</p>
<h3 id="questionnaire">Questionnaire</h3>
<p>I need to know a little about you. Please fill out <a href="Questionnaire.doc">this questionnaire</a> and send 
it to me as soon as possible.</p>
<h2 id="lectures">Lectures</h2>
<strong>There are two sections of this course</strong>: 
  <ul><li>MWF 10:00–11:05 am. x-hour is Thursday, 12:00-12:50 pm. 008 Kemeny</li>
<li>MWF 1:45-2:50 pm. x-hour is Thursday, 1:00-1:50 pm. 200 LSC</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="x-hours">x-hours</h3>
<p>We will occasionally use x-hours, so keep the x-hour times available for this course.  In particular, this we will use
the x-hour this Thursday and a later x-hour as a midterm review.  However, I reserve the right to schedule other x-hours as the need arises.</p>
<h3 id="questions">Questions</h3>
<p>I like it when you ask questions in lecture. I really do. I understand that it can be intimidating to raise your 
hand for a question in a fairly large lecture, but please do not hesitate to ask questions. Don't worry about what 
anyone thinks of you for asking questions. I'll think more of you if you understand the material, and if you need 
to ask questions, that's fine. And don't worry about what the other students might think. Chances are that if you 
have a question, then at least one other student—and possibly many more—has the same question. You're doing the 
other students a favor by asking!</p>
<p>If you still are reluctant to ask a question in lecture, even after all the encouragement in the last paragraph, 
feel free to write it down and ask me, the TA, or any section leader after class, by email, in office hours, or in 
lab hours. We want to help you!!</p>
<p>Occasionally, I might elect to answer a question later or after lecture. That will usually be because the answer 
to the question is tangential to the material we're covering, or simply because I am pressed for time. But please 
feel free to ask; I'll let you know nicely if I cannot answer the question then and there.</p>
<h2 id="recitation-section">Recitation section</h2>
<p><strong>You are invited to attend a one-hour recitation section meeting each week.</strong> Attendance is optional. 
The potential times for section meetings are Wednesday afternoons and evenings, and Thursday mornings, afternoons, 
and evenings.</p>
<p>Download <a href="section-times.doc">this form</a>, and follow the instructions. You must fill it out and email 
it to Professor Drysdale by 1:00 pm on Thursday, September 18, <em>even if you don't intend to ever attend a recitation 
section</em>. (That's because, as in CS 1, your section leader will also be your grader.) The recitation section 
schedule will be determined later that day, and your section assignment will then be posted on the Recitation 
Sections page on the Canvas site. The first recitation sections will meet the week of September 22.</p>
<p>We recognize that occasionally (which means "not on a regular basis"), you might not be able to 
attend the recitation section to which you have been assigned. In that event, please find another section to 
attend that week. Make sure that your regular section leader knows that you'll be attending another section, 
and make sure you get permission <em>in advance</em> from the section leader whose section you'll be visiting.</p>
<h2 id="grading">Grading</h2>
<ul>
<li>Short assignments: 10%</li>
<li>Lab assignments: 50%</li>
<li>Exams: 40%</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no fixed scale for assigning letter grades. The median grade for the course is usually a B+, 
<em>but I make no guarantees in advance</em>. The median grades depend on <em>you</em>.</p>
<h2 id="exams">Exams</h2>
<p>There will be a midterm exam on Thursday, October 23, 6:30 pm to 9:30 pm. If a scheduling conflict prevents you from 
taking the midterm exam at the scheduled time, you must let me know by 5:00 pm on the preceding Monday (October 20). 
<em>No exceptions.</em></p>
<p>The final exam is scheduled by the Registrar.  Unfortunately, the two sections of the course have different 
exam times scheduled.  (I tried to get a single joint time, but failed.) The section that meets at 10 will have 
its final at 8:00 am on Tuesday, November 25 in Cook Auditorium.  The section that meets at 2 will have its final at 11:30 am on 
Sunday, November 23 in 006 Steele.  Make sure that you can take the exam at the assigned period.  </p>
<p>Before each exam, I will post a web page to help you review. There will also be review sessions before the two exams.</p>
<p>Each of the two exams count toward 20% of your final grade.</p>
<h2 id="short-assignments">Short assignments</h2>
<p>Short assignments are relatively brief exercises that you will turn in at the next Monday, Wednesday, or Friday 
class. In some cases, you might have two classes to work on a short assignment. Short assignments will usually 
consist of one or two short programs to help you understand the concept being covered.</p>
<p>You will submit short assignments through the Canvas site. They will have a timestamp, and so we will know 
when you submitted them. They are due at 10:00 am <em>sharp</em> on the day that they are due. If your short 
assignment comes in at 10:01 am, it is late. <strong>Short assignments handed in late will receive no credit.</strong></p>
<p>Your section leader will grade your short assignments on a scale of 0, 1, or 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 means that you essentially got it right, though your section leader might suggest some ways that you could 
improve your work.</li>
<li>1 means that you got it partially right, but not enough to say that you got it "essentially" right.</li>
<li>0 means that either you did not submit the short assignment, or that what you submitted was a very poor effort.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may resubmit up to five short assignments on which you get a 1. If you resubmit a short assignment, you may 
resubmit it one time, and you have to resubmit by the start of the next Monday/Wednesday/Friday class after you got 
back your original assignment. When you resubmit a short assignment, we ask that you do a few things as a 
courtesy to your section leader. First, please make it clear that it is a resubmission. Second, please include your 
original submission along with the resubmission, so that your section leader can see your progress.  Third, send an
email to your section leader to let him or her know that you have resubmitted.  You are allowed 
to look at the sample solution before resubmitting, but should not simply copy it.</p>
<h2 id="lab-assignments">Lab assignments</h2>
<p>In-depth lab assignments will be due on certain Wednesdays through the course; you will usually have one week to work on 
each lab. You are not required to complete the lab assignment in the lab. You may use your own computer wherever you 
like, just as you do for short assignments.</p>
<p>Lab assignments require a significant time commitment. Start early, and if you need to, get advice from me, the TA, 
or a section leader. Remember that you can get help at lab hours.</p>
<p>Like short assignments, you will submit lab assignments via Canvas. They are due at 10:00 am on the day they are due. 
If your lab assignment comes in at 10:01 am, it is late.</p>
<p>If you hand in a lab assignment late but by 5:00 pm the day it's due, we will deduct 10%. If you hand it in between 
5:00 pm the day it's due and 5:00 pm the next day, we will deduct 30%. We will not accept it after 
5:00 pm the next day, and you will get 0.</p>
<p>There are two ways that you can get an exemption from this lateness policy. First, if something happens beyond 
your control that prevents you from doing your assignment on time, then we can excuse a late assignment. Second, 
you may be able to arrange <strong>in advance</strong> to submit your assignment late. You will need a Darned 
Good Reason to do so. Note that you need to ask <strong>in advance</strong>. The day the assignment is due does 
not count as "in advance." <strong>Only Professor Drysdale is authorized to excuse late assignments.</strong> 
Neither the TA nor any section leader is authorized to excuse late assignments.</p>
<p>Yes, this lateness policy is harsh. Why? Because in the past, those who have fallen behind have had a devil of 
a time catching up. So we are trying to prevent you from falling behind. Yes, 30% off for a lab assignment handed 
in at 5:01 pm sucks. In the past, students have complained that they could have handed in something substandard on 
time and gotten more points than if they had handed in something really good a little late. Unfortunately, the Real 
World works this way as well. Imagine showing the World's Best Software…a week after the trade show. <strong>It is 
up to you to plan your time carefully and get your work in on time!</strong></p>
<p>I am, however, not a complete ogre. We will give you a discount on <em>one</em> unexcused late lab assignment submission. There are three possibilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you submit all your lab assignments on time, you don't need a discount.</li>
<li>If you submit some lab assignments late, but whenever you submit a lab assignment late it's in by 5:00 pm the 
day it's due, then we will waive the 10% penalty for one of them.</li>
<li>If you submit any lab assignments between 5:01 pm on the due date and 5:00 pm the next day, we will reduce the 
late penalty from 30% to 15% for one of them. That will be the only discount you get; you won't get any 
discount for lab assignments submitted late but by 5:00 pm on the due date.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you submit a problem set late you are not allowed to look at the posted sample solutions until after you 
submit your solution.</p>
<h2 id="hand-in">Handing in Assignments</h2>
<p>Everything will be submitted through Canvas.  Even when an assignment has some written exercises, 
you are required to either type in a file or scan your written work and submit it electronically. 
To submit output from your program, submit a copy-pasted file in plain text format and/or a 
screenshot, as appropriate. For plain text, you can use a program like TextEdit, NotePad, or 
Emacs, or even Word, but be sure to save as plain text. For a screen shot, you can use 
the Grab utility on a Mac or the PrntScrn button on Windows.</p>

If an assignment requires you to submit multiple files, zip all the files into a single zip file 
and submit that. If you have to revise your submission, submit your new zip file once more, 
with V2 appended (V2 for Version 2, V3 for Version 3, etc.); only the last version will be graded.

<h2 id="partners">Partners</h2>
<p>Much of the learning in this course comes from doing the
programming exercises.  On some lab assignments, you may work jointly
with <em>one</em> other person, if so stated.  No more than two people
may work together on a given problem set.  If you choose to work with
someone else, you and your partner must submit a single joint
assignment with both names on it, and you must work with the same
person for the entire assignment.  You cannot work with one person for
some parts of an assignment and a different person for other parts, 
although you may work with different partners on different assignments.</p>
<p>If you work with a partner, you are still responsible for understanding the
entire assignment.  That means that splitting the coding into two halves, doing your
half, and never looking at your partner's half is not a good idea.  You can learn a
lot by reading your partner's code and figuring out how it works, whether it is correct,
and how it might be improved.  You can also catch things like poor or missing comments that
could cost you style points when the assignment is graded.</p>
<p>I suggest that you borrow a practice from Extreme Programming, a method of writing 
code that many businesses find quite effective.  It is called Pair Programming.  One
person (the driver) sits at the keyboard.  The other person (the navigator) looks at
the screen as the driver types, asking questions, making suggestions, and catching errors.
Both of you will understand the code better if you discuss it as it is written than if you just
write it (or read it) by yourself.  
Regularly trade off who is driver and who is navigator.</p>
<p>The usual reaction to this idea is, "that will take twice as long!"  In practice it is 
usually faster than each person programming alone.  The reason is that errors are caught
earlier, and the amount of time are saved when debugging more than makes up for the lack 
of parallelism in code writing.  Also, the code tends to be better written.  These are the
reasons that this idea has been adopted in industry.</p>
<h2 id="extra-credit">Extra credit</h2>
<p>Some of the assignments may suggest extra credit work. Extra credit in this course will be tallied separately 
from regular scores. If you end up on a borderline between two grades at the end of the course (or are being 
considered for a citation), extra credit will count in your favor. Failure to do extra credit will never be 
counted against you, however. You should do extra credit work if you find it interesting and think that it 
might teach you something. It never pays to skimp on the regular assignments in order to do extra credit problems.</p>
<p>One corollary of the way in which we count extra credit is that if you get a 30 on a lab assignment and 
also 5 points of extra credit, that is <em>not</em> the same as getting a 35 with no extra credit. The latter—35 
points with no extra credit—is far better.</p>
<h2 id="sample-solutions">Sample solutions</h2>
<p>Sample solutions for all of the homework assignments will be posted under the "File" 
tab in Canvas after the assignment is due.

<h2 id="how-to-get-help">How to get help</h2>
<p>There are many ways for you to get help. You can visit me or the TA during office hours, you can go to 003 Sudikoff 
when course staff is there, or you can make an appointment with me, your section leader, or the TA. You should 
also feel free to ask for help by email. You can email a specific person, including me. For a faster response, 
you can get an answer from the first member of the course staff (again including me) to read your message by 
emailing to</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="cs10help-address.png"/><p class="caption"></p>
</div>
<p>This account is a mailing list consisting of me, the TA, and all section leaders. (Note that you have to 
put <u>cs.</u> after the <u>@</u> in the address.) We will try to respond as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If you visit me or any of the course staff for help with a program that you are writing, make sure that 
you can get to an electronic copy of your program. That way, we can try to compile and run it. It's nice to 
have a printed version of your program, but we cannot compile and run a printed version.</p>
<p>When you email a program to one of us, you just need to add your program as an enclosure to your email, 
along with additional information as to what problems you have observed. When you email a question, please 
be as specific as possible, and tell us what you've done to try to figure out a solution for yourself. We 
reserve the right to not answer emails that say nothing more than "My program doesn't work; where is 
the problem?" Make sure you send your program as an enclosure; <em>do not copy and paste your program 
into the message</em>.</p>
<p>If you have a question that does not require you to attach your code, then you might find Piazza to be a 
better source of help. Other students in the course can give you answers to your more conceptual questions, 
and you might find the answer already posted there. <em>Never include your own code in a post to Piazza.</em></p>
<p>The Tutor Clearinghouse is another source of help. They will have private, one-on-one tutors available 
for this class. The tutors are recruited on the basis that they have done well in the subject, and they are 
trained by the Academic Skills Center. If you are on financial aid, the College will pay for three hours a 
week of tutoring. To get a tutor, go to 301 Collis and fill out an application.</p>
<h2 id="lab-help-hours">Lab help hours</h2>
<p>Several days per week, there will be course staff in 003 Sudikoff to lend a hand with assignments or 
anything else you would like help with.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sundays, 7:30 to 10:30 pm, staffed by Joy, Joanne, and Yinan</li>
<li>Mondays, 7:30 to 10:30 pm, staffed by Barry, Josh, Kayla, Nick, and Rick</li>
<li>Tuesdays, 7:30 to 10:30 pm, staffed by Caleb, Delainey, Jessica, Jean-Luc, and Xinran</li>
<li>Thursdays, 7:30 to 10:30 pm, staffed by Emily, Steve, and Yinan</li>
</ul>
<p>003 has a number of Macs that are available for your use.</p>
<p>You might find it useful to do some of the assignments right in the lab. Many of the problems that will 
stump you and waste your time if you are working alone can be cleared up in moments by the course staff. 
Then again, you might not find it useful to work in the lab, depending on how many of your fellow students 
are competing with you for machines, seats, and the attention of the course staff.</p>
<p>Please prepare before going to lab; course staff can be much more helpful if you've already made a solid 
effort at solving the problem you are working on.</p>
<p>003 Sudikoff is locked at all times, but if you're registered for CS 10, you should be able to get in 
with your Dartmouth ID. The entrances to Sudikoff are locked after 6:00 pm, but if you're registered for 
CS 10, you should be able to get into the building with your Dartmouth ID. The second floor of Sudikoff 
also requires card access after 6:00 pm, and again, your Dartmouth ID should get you in, if you're 
registered for CS 10.</p>
<p>Note that there are several restrictions that come with access to Sudikoff. Among them are that you are 
not to lend your Dartmouth ID to anyone else in order to allow them into the building or labs. Also, 
<em>you must not bring food into 003</em>. You may eat at the tables in the hallway outside the lab. 
Food in the labs can make the keyboards darned unpleasant to use, and it can even render machines unusable.</p>
<h2 id="textbook">Textbooks</h2>
<p>The main textbook is <em>Data Structures and Algorithms in Java</em>, <strong>6th edition</strong>, 
by Michael T. Goodrich, Roberto Tamassia, and Michael H. Goldwasser. The bad news: the textbook is required, 
and the paperback version lists for $151.95, 
though <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Data-Structures-Algorithms-Michael-Goodrich/dp/1118771338/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1394580262&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=goodrich+tamassia+java">Amazon</a> 
sells it for less ($97.75 at the moment I wrote this), and they even rent it. The good news: you can 
<a href="http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-EHEP002900.html">purchase an e-book version</a> 
directly from the publisher, Wiley, for "only" $62.50. You'll need to download the VitalSource 
Bookshelf software to read it. And in order to download VitalSource Bookshelf, you'll need to create an 
account on their site. The Wiley site links to the VitalSource site.</p>
<p>A secondary textbook is free on web: 
<a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~mark.guzdial/mediacomp/BETA-dsBook-7-22-09-first4chapters.pdf"><i>
Problem Solving with Data Structures: A Multimedia Approach</i></a>, by Guzdial and Ericson.  (This 
is the first 4 chapters of a preliminary version of a book that they are writing.)  We will be using this 
early in the term.</p>
<h2 id="software">Software</h2>
<p>We will be using Eclipse Standard SDK, Luna Release. (Yeah, that mumbo jumbo doesn't mean anything to 
me, either.) This software is a free Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that runs on both Windows 
and Mac OS X. You will install this software on your own computer as part of the first short assignment.</p>
<p>In class I will sometimes use the interactive programming environment DrJava to demonstrate concepts. It 
has an Interactions window, where
I can type commands and immediately see results.  You are free to use DrJava yourself, if you wish.  It may
be easier to do the first assignment or two in DrJava, but  later assignments are usually easier to do in Eclipse.
The first short assignment will ask you to install both on your computer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Windows users (and, yes, we know that many Dartmouth students have opted for Windows), 
the Mac will be the "primary" machine supported. The CS undergraduate lab for this course contains 
only Macs. I use a MacBook Pro. Some of the course staff have experience with Windows, however, so you may 
find it a good idea to ask them your Windows-specific questions. Because I don't run Windows, I will be unable 
to help you with Windows-specific problems. Indeed, one great asset of our course staff is that many of them 
can help you with Windows issues.</p>
<p>Note that you can always email your program to yourself. So even if you normally run Windows but you want 
to work on a Mac in the lab, you'll be able to work on your own code.</p>
<h2 id="the-web">The Web</h2>
<p>All documents, class examples, lab assignments, short assignments, and sample solutions related to the 
course will be on the web. I will also post class notes (although they are notes, and not intended to be a textbook).  
You can get at them through Canvas, or you can dial direct and go to 
<a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs10/">http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~cs10/</a>. Presumably 
you know how to find the web pages, since you're reading this one. The first short assignment tells you 
how to find the CS 10 information on the web.</p>
<h2 id="honor-principle">Honor Principle</h2>
<p>On exams, all work must be your own. You should work on short assignments alone, but you can get help 
from the course staff and can discuss the assignment with classmates during the design phase. Programs 
for short assignments should be created, typed, documented, and output generated, by yourself. For the 
lab assignments, you may consult freely with instructors and classmates during the phase of designing 
solutions, but you should then work individually (or with a single partner, when allowed) when creating your 
programs—typing, documenting, and 
generating output. During the debugging stage you may discuss your problems with others in the class, 
but you should not copy code to "fix" bugs. To do otherwise is a violation of the Academic 
Honor Principle. If you work with a classmate on any assignment, you should tell us who you worked with 
in a comment at the beginning of your program.</p>
<p>You should attribute the proper source in any code that you submit that you did not write yourself. 
This includes code that you take from outside references—for example a book other than the course text. 
And it even includes code that you take from class examples, the textbook, or the assignments. (I agree that 
may be tedious to attribute the source in code that we have given you, but we want you to be in the habit 
of attributing your sources.  Also, code that we distribute will usually have an author at the top.  Just 
add your name, saying "modified by Jane Doe to solve PS 1" or whatever.)</p>
<p>If you resubmit a short assignment and use code from the published solution (or even look at the sample
solution to get ideas), you should attribute that. 
Note also that proper respect for copyright laws as it applies to printed and software products is part 
of the Computing Code of Ethics.</p>
<p>Whenever we ask you to turn in sample runs of your program, the runs you turn in must be the result of 
actually running your program. It is a violation of the Academic Honor Principle to falsely represent 
output as coming from your program if it did not. If you change your program, make sure to generate 
output from the version of the program that you hand in. It's amazing how a seemingly minor change to 
the code can cause a big change to the output of a program. Also, make sure that when you are running 
a program, that it is your program; it is easier than you might think on a public Mac to run a program 
that someone else had left on the machine.</p>
<p>In the past, we have had a few incidents in which students turned in output that did not come from 
the program handed in. In each case, it turned out that the student had made a foolish mistake (in not 
rerunning the program or handing in an old version of the program or the output) and had not intended 
to misrepresent the work. Yet it caused many an uncomfortable moment for the student and also for the 
student's section leader and for the professor as well. So please endeavor to verify that you're handing 
in output that comes from the very program you're handing in.</p>
<p>It is not easy to come up with good homework problems that help you learn a concept, are interesting, 
and require an appropriate amount of work. Over the years we have developed and refined a number of 
homework problems, and I plan to reuse some of them for this class. You should not look at any solutions 
to homeworks assigned in previous terms, including sample solutions, or solutions written by other students.</p>
<p>We have had some uncomfortable situations occur in the past, and I want to make it clear what the 
policy is. Two students, Alice and Ralph, discuss an assignment and design their code together. That 
is fine. But then they decide that since their programs would be so similar, they might as well have 
Alice type in the code, have Ralph make his own copy of the file containing the code, and then have 
Ralph make his own minor changes. This is a violation of the Academic Honor Principle. Although you 
may discuss and design with others, the code you hand in must be entirely your own.</p>
<p>Here's another situation that occurred. Trixie and Ed start working independently on a program. 
Trixie finishes and has a working version. Ed has trouble with his. Trixie helps Ed debug. That is 
fine. But then Trixie realizes that Ed has a section of code that is all wrong and the program she 
wrote has just the right code for that section. She shows Ed her program. Or worse, she gives Ed an 
electronic copy of her program so that he can just paste in the correct code. Either action is a 
violation of the Academic Honor Principle.</p>
<p>I realize that it can be hard to decide when you might be violating the Academic Honor Principle 
when we let you collaborate to a limited extent. Here is a good rule of thumb. If you are talking 
in normal English (or Chinese or German or some other natural language) you are probably OK. If you 
find yourself talking in Java code, you have crossed the line. So saying, "Your program runs 
forever because you have the wrong condition in the while loop" is OK. But saying, "Change 
while (x == 0) to while (x &gt;= 0)" is not.</p>
<p>If you have any question about whether what you're doing is within the Academic Honor Principle, 
do not hesitate to check with me. If it's late and you can't find me, you're better off erring on 
the side of caution.</p>
<p>Most violations of the Academic Honor Principle come down to failure to cite work that is not 
yours. If you copy any portion of your program from your friend Elvira and represent it as your work, 
then you either intended to deceive or were careless about citing. Either case is a violation of 
the Academic Honor Principle. If you copy your entire program from Elvira but include the comment, 
"This code was copied in its entirety from Elvira," then you cited properly, though you 
didn't actually do the work. In this latter case, I would not report a violation of the Academic 
Honor Principle, though your grade on the assignment would be 0. But that would be far preferable 
to a COS hearing.</p>
<p>The same goes for code that you find in some other book or on the Internet. You are in violation 
of the Academic Honor Principle if you fail to attribute your sources.</p>
<p>You don't need to cite if you wrote the code yourself. You don't need to cite just because you're 
using a construct you saw elsewhere. For example, you need not cite for using 
<code>System.out.println("Hello")</code>, even though it was in the class examples. That 
would be like citing "printing press" in an essay! Nor do you have to cite just because 
you use a while-loop, even though you saw a while-loop in a class example. It's when you lift several 
lines of code from elsewhere that you need to cite.</p>
<p>To cite, include in a comment—near the top of your file is fine—stating where you got the code from:</p>
<pre class="sourceCode"><code class="sourceCode java"><span class="co">// Based on code from page 66 of the textbook.</span></code></pre>
<p>Please do not cheat. Cheaters—whether or not they are caught—bring dishonor upon themselves and 
upon everyone else at Dartmouth. To do that, for just a few lousy points in a course, is [insert 
your favorite strong adjective meaning "stupid" here]. Furthermore, if you cannot solve 
the short assignments and lab assignments on your own, then you will have trouble with the exams.</p>
<p>I have served on the COS, and I have seen what happens to students who are caught cheating: they 
take an involuntary vacation from Dartmouth for several terms. I have brought several Academic 
Honor Principle cases to the COS, and I hate having to do so. Please don't make me.</p>
<h2 id="special-note-for-when-you-work-on-a-computer-that-anyone-else-might-use">Special note for 
when you work on a computer that anyone else might use</h2>
<p>If you are working on a computer that is not yours—especially a Mac in 003 Sudikoff—or that 
someone else in the course might use, you should be very careful to remove your code from the 
computer when you are all done. You should probably email your code to yourself before you remove 
the code. Why do we tell you to do this? Because if you leave your code on a computer, and someone 
else can see it, then they can copy it and hand it in. If that happens, then we have a bad situation 
involving you (the copy-ee) and the other person (the copy-er), and it's difficult—if not 
impossible—to tell who was the copy-ee and who was the copy-er. By removing your code from the 
computer when you're done, you can avoid getting yourself into that situation.</p>
<p>To remove your code, you'll want to delete it from the Eclipse workspace. And you'll also want to 
move any other copies on the computer to the Trash (or the Recycling Bin) and empty it.</p>
<h2 id="religious-observances">Religious observances</h2>
<p>Some students may wish to take part in religious observances that occur during this academic term. 
If you have a religious observance that conflicts with your participation in the course, please meet 
with me before the end of the second week of the term to discuss appropriate accommodations.</p>
<h2 id="disabilities">Disabilities</h2>
<p>I encourage students with disabilities, including "invisible" disabilities such as chronic 
diseases and learning disabilities, to discuss with me after class or during my office hours appropriate 
accommodations that might be helpful to you.</p>
<p>Students with disabilities enrolled in this course and who may need disability-related classroom 
accommodations are encouraged to make an appointment to see me before the end of the second week of 
the term. All discussions will remain confidential, although the Student Accessibility Services office 
may be consulted to discuss appropriate implementation of any accommodation requested.</p>
<h2 id="advice">Advice</h2>
<p>Read the material I ask you to read, and follow the instructions. Many students have wasted a lot 
of their valuable time, and their grades have suffered, simply because they did not follow directions. </p>
<p>Start all assignments early. With few exceptions you'll know 
everything you need to do an assignment at the time that you get it. There is no reason to procrastinate.  
If you start early you will have enough time to get 
stuck, put the assignment aside, and later get help from the course staff.  You will be able to do that
several times during the week (when we usually are not very busy). 
That works better than trying to get help the night before the assignment is due (when we are often very 
busy, with waiting lines.)</p>
<p>At the same time, do not be afraid to get help. The purpose of this course is not to waste your time. 
If you are spinning and not making progress on a problem, please see me, the TA, or a section leader. 
We can point you in the right direction without giving away the store.</p>
