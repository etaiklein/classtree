<h1 id="lab-assignment-2-k-means-due-wednesday-October-8-at-1000-am">Lab Assignment 2: Singly linked list.<br/>Due: Wednesday, October 8 at 10:00 am</h1>
<p>
I suggest start on this problem set early.
If you start early, you are likely not to find it difficult at all.
On the other hand, if you start late and make some mistakes in manipulating references
(which is easy to do when dealing with linked lists), it may be too late to get help.

<p>This assignment will give you experience with low-level data structure
manipulations.  Most of the time we will be using pre-packaged
implementations of ADTs to solve problems.  However, being able to write your own data 
structures to implement an ADT, when necessary, is a useful skill.  It is also important to 
understand something about what is being hidden inside ADTs in order to be able
to make intelligent tradeoffs.</p>
<h2>Modify <code>SLL.java</code></h2>
<p>We saw that a major drawback to <code>SLL.java</code> is the fact that
deletion is an <em>O</em>(<em>n</em>) operation, because of the need to find the predecessor
of the current item in order to delete it.  
In class I briefly mentioned a way
to get around this problem by using a dummy list header and keeping track
of the item <em>before</em> the current 
item.  In this part of the assignment you will modify 
<a href="SLL.java"><code>SLL.java</code></a>
to use this representation.  I suggest renaming the class.  Mine is called
<code>HeaderSLL</code>, but you can choose whatever name that you like.</p>
<p>You could still call the instance variable <code>current</code>, 
but it is less confusing to call it <code>currentPred</code> or 
some such name.  This is an excellent chance to use refactoring in Eclipse.
Select the name "current" in its declaration, chose "Rename" from within
the Refactor menu, change the name, and hit return.  All instances of the 
variable get renamed.  The comments don't need to change, because we still
have the same idea of current.  We have just changed how we represent it.</p>
<p>For the basic assignment you should eliminate the <code>tail</code> instance
variable.  Updating this efficiently turns out to be trickier
than it would first appear.  Keeping track of the tail of the list
will be extra credit.</p>
<p>Our SLL with dummy header and currentPred is shown below.  The first
element in the linked list (with <code>data</code> field <code>null</code>) is not 
part of the list represented.  It is like the sentinel in <code>SentinelDLL</code>.
It is there to make operations easier.  This represents a list with 3 elements,
not 4.</p>
<p>Note that 
the current item is "NH", because <code>currentPred</code> 
refers to the element before it in the list.  Note that using this representation, 
deleting the current item will be the same no matter which item is deleted.
You simply change the <code>next</code> field in the element referenced by
<code>currentPred</code>.  This is the advantage of having a dummy list head.</p>
<center>
<img src="SLL.jpg">
</img></center>
<p>So what should an empty list look like?  The following shows <code>head</code>,
<code>currentPred</code>, and the dummy list header.  Note that <code>currentPred</code>
references the dummy list header rather than being null.  But if you follow 
<code>next</code> from the dummy list header you get null, so this indicates that
there is no current.  This is the situation that will arise naturally if you remove 
the only item in a list, so it is more convenient than using <code>currentPred == null</code>
as the test for no current.</p>
<center>
<img src="empty.jpg">
</img></center>
<p>Draw pictures of what the list should look like before and after various operations.
Use them to figure out the names of fields that need to be changed and the values
that they need to be changed to.  In many cases the only change needed is to use
<code>currentPred.next</code> in places that <code>SLL.java</code> used <code>current</code>.

<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>Run your program with <a href="ListTest.java"><code>ListTest.java</code></a>
to demonstrate that it works.  Notice that you have to change one line in <code>ListTest.java</code>
in order to be able to test your implementation.
Figure out which line it is and fix it.

<p>
Make sure to test all of the boundary cases - adding and 
removing at the front of the list, the end of the list, the middle of the list, etc.
Make sure that things work correctly for an empty list.  Your testing should not be
random, but should be clearly organized and complete enough to convince us that your 
program works correctly.</p>
<h3>Extra credit: Include <code>tail</code></h3>
<p>Create an instance variable <code>tail</code> and maintain it correctly as 
you do adds and removes.  One thing that you will need to decide is
whether <code>tail</code> should point to the last element in the list or
to the element before the last element. (Note that <code>head</code> and
<code>currentPred</code> point to the element before the one that they really
mean.)</p>
<p>It is easy to introduce subtle bugs.  Test your code carefully.</p>
<p>Please turn in a solution to the standard problem separately from the extra credit solution
(i.e., keep the two solutions as different files).
Solving the standard problem and then modifying it to use
<code>tail</code> is probably easier than starting with the tail instance variable.
Furthermore, by keeping them as two separate solutions,
you will not be penalized in your regular grade for errors in the 
extra credit part.</p>
<h2>Canvas submission</h2>

Submit via Canvas the following files:

<ol>
<li> your modification of the <code>SLL</code> class.

  <li> test run for your modified <code>SLL</code> class.

  <li> An updated version of the <code>SLL</code> class if you did the extra credit.
  (You should have one file with just the original assignment and 
  another for extra credit, because sometimes adding the extra credit breaks something
  in the original assignment.)

</li></li></li></ol>
<h2>Grading rubric</h2>

On programming assignments it is important to write the code well enough that it compiles and runs,
enabling you to test it thoroughly and tune it to perfection.
Therefore, starting with this problem set, there will be a much more severe deduction of points
for code that does not compile and for code that compiles and runs but does not accomplish much.
