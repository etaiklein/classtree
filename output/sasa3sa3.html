<h1 id="short-assignment-1-due-monday-september-22">Short Assignment 3 <br/>Due: Wednesday, September 24.</h1>
<p>The <code>Picture.java</code> file from the <code>java source</code> folder
contains a number of methods to transform images.  This assignment asks
you to add an additional method to that file that transforms an
image by replacing each pixel color by a weighted sum of its color and 
the colors of  its eight
adjacent pixels.  Image processing people call this a convolution, so
your method should be called <code>convolve</code>.  You may find it 
useful to 
write a private helper method that deals with a single pixel.  You may
call this method whatever you like (as long as the name is meaningful).</p>
<p>The method <code>public Picture convolve(double [][] matrix, String title)</code> 
takes a parameter that is a 3 x 3 matrix of weights and a parameter that is the
title of the new picture that you produce.  
For each pixel that is not on the edge of
the <code>Picture</code> you should produce a new pixel whose color
is the weighted sum of its color and the colors of the surrounding
pixels.  (Pixels on the edge should not be changed.)  The red, green, 
and blue values must be summed separately in order to get the red, green, and 
blue values for the new color.  Finally, you should use the <code>SimplePicture</code> method <code>setTitle</code> to change the label on the picture that you 
produce so that you can tell which picture came from which matrix.</p>
<p>Note that the original
<code>Picture</code> should not be changed.  Follow the example of <code>flip</code>,
<code>blueScreen</code>, and the other methods that return a <code>Picture</code>.  
Create a new <code>Picture</code> and fill in
the correct pixel values in that.</p>
<p>The pixel above and to the
left of the current pixel should be multiplied by <code>matrix[0][0]</code>,
the one directly above should be multiplied by <code>matrix[0][1]</code>,
the one above and to the right should be multiplied by 
<code>matrix[0][2]</code>, and so on.  Thus the pixel itself is multiplied 
by <code>matrix[1][1]</code> and the pixel down and to the right is multiplied
by <code>matrix[2][2]</code>.  These products should be added together to get
the new value.  
</p>
<p>There are many useful methods in the <code>Pixel</code> class that you will want to use.  In particular, the <code>correctValue</code> method will prove useful to make sure 
that the sums that you compute are in range.  </p>
<p>Test your code on the following three test matrices:</p>
<xmp>
    double ninth = 1.0/9.0;
    double [][] blur = {{ninth, ninth, ninth}, 
                       {ninth, ninth, ninth}, 
                       {ninth, ninth, ninth}}; 
    
    double [][] edges = {{-1.0, -1.0, -1.0},
                         {-1.0, 8.0, -1.0},
                         {-1.0, -1.0, -1.0}};

    double [][] sharpen = {{-1.0, -1.0, -1.0},
                           {-1.0, 9.0, -1.0},
                           {-1.0, -1.0, -1.0}};
</xmp>
<p>The names give some idea of what the matrices do.  Thus <code>blur</code>
should make the picture slightly blurred (soft focus), 
<code>edges</code> detects boundaries between different colors, and 
<code>sharpen</code> makes boundaries more distinct.  I suggest changing the 
<code>main</code> method to display the original picture and to 
create and display the three modified pictures.</p>
<h3>Setting up Eclipse to work with media files</h3>
<p>If you want to use Eclipse instead of DrJava to solve this homework (or other
homeworks that use the media files that you downloaded) you have two choices.  The 
first is to create a new project and drag all of the files in java-source  
(except the "doc" folder) into it.</p>
<p>The other choice is to set classpaths, just as you did in DrJava.  This explains how.</p>
<ol>
<li>Go into the Eclipse menu and select Preferences.  A window should open with General as a 
choice.  Click the triangle (or whatever) to expand the choices under General.  One of them 
is Workspace.  When you expand Workspace, one option is Linked Resources.  Click on this.  There
should be a check box labeled "Enable linked resources".  Check it if it is unchecked.</li>
<li>Click on your your project in the Package Explorer window on the left side
  (mine is called <code>cs10proj</code>), go to the File menu, and select Properties.
  A window should open.</li>
<li>Click on "Java Build Path" in the list of choices on the left side of the window.</li>
<li>Click on "Libraries" in the choices along the top of the window.</li>
<li>Click on "Add External Class Folder" and navigate to the folder <code>java-source.</code>  
  Select it and click "Open". The folder <code>java-source</code> should now be added as a build path.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can now add <code>Picture.java</code> to the project, edit it, and run it. </p>
<h2>Turn in</h2>
<p>Electronically turn in your modifed <code>Picture.java</code> file (with
comments indicating where your modification is) on Canvas.  Also 
electronically turn in screen shot(s) showing the <code>beach.jpg</code> image and the
<code>convolve</code> method run on this image  for
each of the three matrices.  (I was able to lay them out on the screen
so that one screen shot showed all four.)</p>
<h3>Extra Credit</h3>
<p>Find other matricies that give interesting effects.</p>
