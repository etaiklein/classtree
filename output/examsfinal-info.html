<h1 id="information-on-midterm-exam">Information on the Final Exam</h1>
<h2 id="ground-rules">Ground rules</h2>
<p>The final exam for the 2-hour section will be on Sunday, November 23 at 11:30 am in 006 Steele. The exam for the 10-hour section will be on Tuesday, November 25 at 8:00 am at Cook Auditorium.</p>
<p>The registrar specifies that the final exam period will be three hours.  The exam is designed to take less than three hours.  If you are still making progress after three hours, I can let you have a few more minutes, but out of fairness to those who have an exam in the period after ours I cannot let you go longer.</p>
<p>You may bring a <strong>crib sheet</strong> to the exam, subject to the following restrictions. The crib sheet must be a single sheet of paper, 8.5 by 11 inches at the largest. You may write on both sides of the sheet. You may write whatever you like. If you would rather type your sheet you must use at least a 10 point font.</p>
<p>You may pick up your graded exam later in the exam period or at the beginning of one of the next few terms.</p>
<h2 id="review-session">Review sessions</h2>
<p>There will be a review session at 10 am on Wednesday, November 17 in Filene Auditorium in Moore Hall. Attendance is optional. Come for as much or as little of it as you like.</p>
<p>I will have office hours Tuesday and Wednesday afternoons.  I will be leaving for a conference on Thursday and will return late Saturday night, so <strong>I will not be around on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday.</strong>  Please ask any questions that you have at the review session or at office hours Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-should-know">What you should know</h2>
<p>The exam will concentrate on material starting with the Monday, October 20 lecture (hash tables).  That does not mean that you can forget about loops, iterators, sets, maps, lists, etc.  You may need those things to write programs or otherwise answer questions.  However, the questions will all involve topics from the second half of the course.</p>
<p>Don't forget that you can link to the official lecture notes for each lecture from the <a href="http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~scot/cs10/schedule.html">schedule page</a>. </p>
<h2 id="sample-questions">Sample exams</h2>
<p>There are links the Winter 2012 and the Winter 2012 finals on the exams web page.  I have also linked the solutions to these exams.  You will get a mini-manual with descriptions of methods from classes that you need to answer questions, so you need not record this sort of information on your crib sheet.  I may supplement these with additional classes on the actual exam.  If during the exam you need a description of a class that was not given to you let me know and I will pull up the documentation.</p>
<p> I recommend taking the sample exams before looking at the solutions.</p>
