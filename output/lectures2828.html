<h2>Dining Philosophers</h2>
<p>Allowing only one thread in any synchronized method at a given time allows us to
deal with the concurrency problems we saw with <code>Incrementer</code>, but it can
be overly restrictive in some cases.  For instance, allowing only one thread to access
a large database would be overly restrictive.  It would be better to allow a program
to "lock" a given piece of data while it processed it, while allowing other programs
to process other pieces of data in the same database.  It is often useful to have resources
that can be "checked out" for your exclusive use and then "checked back in" when you are done. 
This can be accomplished via a mechanism called a semaphore in some of the literature
and a lock in other parts of the literature.  The basic idea is that you can ask to
acquire a resource, and only one request will be granted at a time and the resource
will be unavailable to other threads or processes until it is released.</p>
<p>While this allows more flexible access to resources and more concurrent processing,
it leads to two nasty problems: deadlock and starvation.  Deadlock occurs when the 
pattern of resource acquisition
has produced a state where no thread in a set of threads may proceed because each needs a
resource that another is holding.  They wait forever.  Starvation is when some thread never
gets a resource that it needs, even though the needed resources are acquired and freed by
other processes.  The particular process just never manages to get all of the resources it
needs at the same time.</p>
<p>These two problems are commonly illustrated in the "dining
philosophers" problem.  Suppose there are <em>n</em> philosophers
sitting around a circular table with <em>n</em> forks, one between
each pair of philosophers.  Every so often, a philosopher decides to
eat, and to do so must pick up two forks â€” one on his
left and one on his right.  After acquiring the forks, the
philosopher eats for a while before putting them both back down.
Deadlock and starvation can arise because of the limited resources
(for some reason, those poor philosophers never have enough forks
to go around).</p>
<p>In the naive fork acquisition algorithm, a philosopher first
picks up the left fork and then the right fork.  So it can
be the case that each gets the left fork, but the right fork
is held by their neighbor.  We have a deadlock, where nobody can proceed.</p>
<p>For a deadlock to occur, we need three conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each process or thread needs multiple resources.</li>
<li>A thread can hold some resources while waiting to acquire others</li>
<li>A circular "wait-for" pattern can occur</li>
</ol></body></html>
<p>The algorithm described certainly satisfies all of these conditions.  Each
philosopher needs 2 forks.  As described above he picks up one and then
tries to pick up the other.  And we can have each philosopher holding his
left fork while waiting for his right fork, so we can get a circular
wait-for pattern.</p>
<p>So how can we solve this problem?  One easy way it to make 2 impossible.
We can allow a philosopher to pick up forks only if both are available.
But how can we do this?  What if both forks are free when the philosopher
checks, but a neighbor grabs the second one after he picks up the first?  A
monitor will solve that problem.  Consider the classes 
<a href="../27/ForksMonitor.java">ForksMonitor</a> and 
<a href="../27/PhilosopherMonitor.java">PhilosopherMonitor</a>.</p>
<p>First, we create a class to deal with the forks.  The forks are represented
by a boolean array, where true indicates the fork is in use.  Note that a 
philosopher trying to pick up forks can only do so if both are free.
The synchronized qualifier prevents anyone from grabbing them after
he checks.  After eating a philosopher puts down both forks and notifies
any waiting philosophers that they can try to proceed.</p>
<code>
public class ForksMonitor {
  public boolean [] forks;     // True indicates that the fork is taken
  
  /**
   * Construct a object with num forks.
   * Mark all as not in use.
   * @param num number of forks (and philosophers)
   */
  public ForksMonitor(int num) {
    forks = new boolean[num];
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; forks.length; i++)
      forks[i] = false;
  }
  
  /**
   * Pick up forks numbered pNum and pNum+1 (wrapping).  
   * Block if either fork is in use.
   * pNum the number of the first fork
   */
  public synchronized void pickUpForks(int pNum) throws InterruptedException {
    // If either fork is in use wait
    while (forks[pNum] || forks[(pNum+1) % forks.length] )   
        wait();
    
    // Take the forks
    forks[pNum] = true;
    forks[(pNum+1) % forks.length] = true;
  }
  
  /**
   * Put down forks numbered pNum and pNum+1 (wrapping).  
   * Assumes that this philosopher had been granted the forks.
   * pNum the number of the first fork
   */
  public synchronized void putDownForks(int pNum) throws InterruptedException {  
    // Put down the forks
    forks[pNum] = false;
    forks[(pNum+1) % forks.length] = false;
    notifyAll();
  }
}
</code>
<p>The philosophers each get a thread. In their <code>eat</code> method each
picks up the forks (perhaps after waiting), eats, puts down the forks, and
thinks.  This is repeated <code>NUM_MEALS</code> times in each philosopher's
<code>run</code> method.  Demonstrate.</p>
<code>
public class PhilosophersMonitor extends Thread {
  private int myNum;   // Number of this philosopher
  private ForksMonitor forks;
  private Random generator;
  private static final int EAT_TIME = 1000;
  private static final int THINK_TIME = 1000;
  private static final int NUM_MEALS = 10;
  private static final int NUM_PHILOSOPHERS = 6;
  
  public PhilosophersMonitor(int philNum, ForksMonitor theForks) {
    myNum = philNum;
    forks = theForks;
    generator = new Random();
  }
  
  /**
   * Eat using a monitor to control the forks
   * @param meal the number of the meal eaten
   */ 
  public void eat(int meal) 
        throws InterruptedException {
    
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " trys to pick up forks");
    forks.pickUpForks(myNum);
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " picks up forks and eats meal " + meal);
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " puts down forks and thinks");
    forks.putDownForks(myNum);
    
    sleep(THINK_TIME + generator.nextInt(THINK_TIME));
  }
  
  /**
   * The code to eat NUM_MEALS meals is in the run method of the thread.
   */
  public void run() {
    try {
      for(int meal = 1; meal &lt;= NUM_MEALS; meal++) 
        eat(meal);    
    } catch(InterruptedException e){}
  }
  
  /**
   * Create NUM_PHILOSOPHERS philosopher threads and start them eating
   */
  public static void main(String [] args) {
    ForksMonitor forks = new ForksMonitor(NUM_PHILOSOPHERS);  
    
    for(int num = 0; num &lt; NUM_PHILOSOPHERS; num++) {
      PhilosophersMonitor phil = new PhilosophersMonitor(num, forks);
      phil.start();
    }
  }
}
</code>
<p>This approach does have drawbacks.  A philosopher can starve if
one of his neigbors always has a fork.  As long as one of them is eating
while the other is thinking this can occur.  Using a monitor also prevents
two philosophers on opposite sides of the table from picking up forks 
simultaneously, which is not necessary.</p>
<p>An alternate approach is to protect each fork.  There is a construct
called a semaphore in which threads wait for the semaphore, take the semaphore
and do their thing, and then release the semaphore.  Java does not directly
provide semaphores, but we can use sychronization to achieve this.  Consider
the <code>ForkSemaphore</code> inner class in
<a href="../27/PhilosopherSemaphore.java">PhilosopherSemaphore</a>.  The
semaphore has an instance variable <code>available</code> that is true when the fork
is available.  As in <code>BoundedBuffer</code>, the <code>acquire</code> method has
a while loop, within which is a call to <code>wait</code>.  The <code>release</code>
method sets <code>available</code> to true and notifies any other threads that the fork is now
available.</p>
<code>
private class ForkSemaphore {
  private boolean available;  // true means it is available
			
  public ForkSemaphore() {
    available = true;
  }

  public synchronized void acquire() throws InterruptedException {
    while (!available) {
      wait();
    }
    available = false;
  }

  public synchronized void release() {
    available = true;
    notifyAll();
  }
}
</code>
<p>The class <code>PhilosophersSemaphore</code> creates an array of forks,
creates the appropriate number of philosophers (each with its own number), and 
and calls <code>start</code> on each philosopher to start it running.</p>
<p>A second inner class <code>Philosoper</code> extends <code>Thread</code>.  Each 
philosopher remembers its own number. When it is time to eat he first acquires the 
left fork and then the right.  We call the method that does this <code>starve</code>,
because it can deadlock.  The <code>run</code> method calls <code>starve</code> repeatedly,
with pauses for eating before putting down the forks and pauses for thinking before
trying to eat again.  Demonstrate.  The <code>sleep(10)</code> before picking up the 
second fork delays it enough to cause a deadlock.</p>
<code>
public class Philosopher extends Thread {
  private int myNum;        // this philosopher's positon number

  public Philosopher(int num) {
    myNum = num;
  }

			
  /**
    * Eat using semaphores to control the forks
    */ 
  public void starve(int meal) 
      throws InterruptedException {
		  	
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " trys to pick up fork " + myNum);
    forks[myNum].acquire();
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " has fork " + myNum + 
      " and trys to pick up fork " +  ((myNum+1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS));
    sleep(10);	  	
    forks[(myNum+1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS].acquire();
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " eats meal " + meal);
		  	
    sleep(EAT_TIME + generator.nextInt(EAT_TIME));
		  	
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " puts down forks and thinks");
    forks[myNum].release();
    forks[(myNum+1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS].release();
		  	
    sleep(THINK_TIME + generator.nextInt(THINK_TIME));
  }
		  
		  
  public void run() {
    try {
      for(int meal = 1; meal &lt;= NUM_MEALS; meal++) 
        starve(meal);		
    } catch(InterruptedException e){}
  }
}
</code>
<p>How can we avoid this deadlock?  Make it so that condition 3 (circular wait)
cannot happen.  One approach is for each philosopher to grab the lower-numbered
fork first.  This is a special case of a general approach to avoiding deadlocks.
This approach puts a linear order resources and requires a task to acquire the
resources in increasing order and release them in decreasing order.  (If all 
resources are released at the same time the order that they are released in does
not matter, but if you are going to release some - but not all - resources and then
acquire others it does matter.)  Doing this prevents a loop.  If there were a loop
one of the threads T in the loop would hold a resource R that is larger than any resource
held by any other thread in the loop.  But this thread cannot be waiting for a 
resource held by another thread, because resources that they hold all have lower
values that R so would have been acquired before T acquired R.</p>
<p>Another approach is to have a waiter prevent the last philosopher from 
taking the last fork until some other philospher puts down his forks.</p>
<p>Perhaps the
most elegant approach is to have even-numbered philosophers grab their left
fork first and odd-numbered philosophers grab their right fork first.  (For an even
number of philosophers this effectively
breaks the forks into two resource classes, those to be acquired first and those to
be acquired second.  For an odd number it is a bit more complicated, but still works.)  
This is approach is seen in the <code>eat</code> method of 
<a href="../27/PhilosopherSemaphore.java">PhilosopherSemaphore</a>.  Demonstrate
it.</p>
<code>
/**
  * Eat using semaphores to control the forks
   * This version cannot deadlock
   */ 
public void eat(int meal) 
    throws InterruptedException {
		  	
  if(myNum % 2 == 0) {
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " trys to pick up fork " + myNum);
    forks[myNum].acquire();
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " has fork " + myNum + 
        " and trys to pick up fork " +  ((myNum+1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS));
    sleep(10);
    forks[(myNum+1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS].acquire();
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " eats meal " + meal);
  }
  else {
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " trys to pick up fork " + 
        ((myNum+1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS));
    forks[(myNum+1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS].acquire();
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " has fork " + 
        ((myNum+1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS) + " and trys to pick up fork " +  myNum);
    sleep(10);
    forks[myNum].acquire();
    System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " eats meal " + meal);
  }
  sleep(EAT_TIME + generator.nextInt(EAT_TIME));
		  	
  System.out.println("Philosopher " + myNum + " puts down forks and thinks");
  forks[myNum].release();
  forks[(myNum+1) % NUM_PHILOSOPHERS].release();
		  	
  sleep(THINK_TIME + generator.nextInt(THINK_TIME));
 }

<h2>Other Approaches</h2>
<p>There are other approaches for handling concurrent processes and threads.  One
is message passing.  Instead of sharing memory processes send messages to one another.</p>
<p>Another is called Software Transactional Memory.  The idea is that you specify a group
of actions that should take place atomically.  That is, nothing else should access or
change the information that the actions are reading or changing.  The idea comes from
databases.  When you are dealing with records in a database it is impractical to lock the
entire database to do a transaction.  The way that databases work is that you perform a group
of operations called a transaction.  All actions are recorded in a log.  You then commit the 
transaction.  If no other process has interacted with the records that the transaction has dealt
with (which can be determined from the log) you record all changes.  Otherwise you "roll back" 
to the state before you began the transaction.  Thus the whole transaction completes successfully
or nothing appears to have happened at all. </p>
