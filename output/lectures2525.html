<p>Finish Balanced Binary Search Tree deletion and B-Trees</p>
<a name="skip"></a>
<h2>Skip Lists</h2>
<p>Implementing a map using a sorted array gives a very efficient  
<code>get</code> operation via binary search (O(log n)). However, insertions and deletions are
O(n).</p>
<p>Implementing a map using a doubly linked list is very efficient for insertions 
and deletions (O(1)). But <code>get</code> is (O(n)).</p>
<p>We saw a way to solve this problem using binary search trees.  But is there a way that
we can use a sorted doubly linked list and still get fast lookup?</p>
<p>One way is to build a special sort of indexing structure of lists.  The bottommost list
keeps all of the elements in sorted order, with end markers -INF and INF.  Each successive 
level "skips" every second item,
with links between items with the same value in successive levels. So we have horizontal
linked lists of elements and vertical towers of the same element.  Such a structure is shown 
below.
<xmp>
S4   -INF &lt;--------------------------------------------------------------------------&gt; INF
       |                                                                                |
S3   -INF &lt;---------------------------------------------------------&gt;  80 &lt;----------&gt; INF
       |                                                                |               |
S2   -INF &lt;-----------------------&gt;  15 &lt;---------------------------&gt;  80 &lt;----------&gt; INF
       |                              |                                 |               |
S1   -INF &lt;--------&gt;  8 &lt;---------&gt;  15 &lt;----------&gt;  50  &lt;---------&gt;  80 &lt;----------&gt; INF
       |              |               |                |                |               |
S0   -INF &lt;-&gt;  4 &lt;-&gt;  8 &lt;-&gt;  10 &lt;-&gt;  15 &lt;-&gt;  20  &lt;-&gt;  50  &lt;-&gt; 61  &lt;-&gt;  80 &lt;-&gt;  100 &lt;-&gt; INF
</xmp>
<p>So how can we search in this structure, say to find 61?  Start at the upper left corner.  
Search through the topmost list until we find something bigger than 61.  That isn't hard;
INF is the first thing that we see.  So back up, go down a level, and search that list.  
This time we find 80, back up, and drop to list S<sub>2</sub> at -INF.  We go past 15 and find 80.
We back up to 15, drop down a level to 15 in S1, and start searching.  We skip over 50 and
stop at 80.  We back up to 50 and drop to 50 in S0. The next item is 61, which is not bigger
than 61, so we go to 80, back up to 61, and discover that there is nothing to drop down to.  
Therefore we have found the biggest item less than or equal to 61, and it is indeed 61.
(If we were looking for 60 we would stop at 61, back up to 50, realize that is no level to drop down to, and therefore that 60 is not
in the list.)</p>
<p>So how long does this take?  Well, there are 1 + log<sub>2</sub> n levels, because log<sub>2</sub> n
is precisely the number of times that we can divide n by 2 before we get down to a single item.
How much time do we spend on each level?  We look at 1 item or 2 items.  When we find something
bigger and back up there was at most one item between the corresponding items at the next level 
down.  So we look at it and drop down, or skip over it and find the same item that made us drop
down from the level above. So we compare to at most 2(1 + log<sub>2</sub> n) items.</p>
<p>But doesn't this take a lot of space?  After all, we have a tower of log<sub>2</sub> n 80's.
That is true, but it doesn't matter.  We have n things in S0, n/2 things in S1, and in general
n/2<sup>k</sup> things in Sk.  Summing all of these gives 2n-1.  We also have 2(1 + log<sub>2</sub> n)
end markers. but the whole thing is Θ(n).</p>
<p>Great.  But how does this help us?  We can do better with a sorted array and binary search.  How
about inserting and deleting?  To insert first do a search, and insert after the thing found in S0.
To delete find the thing and then delete it and its tower (if any) from S0 and all of the lists 
above where it appears.  So insertion is O(1) after search and deletion is O(log n) after search
because we can do a deletion on each level and deleting from a doubly linked list is O(1).</p>
<p>But wait a second.  Inserting or deleting this way will mess up the structure.  After a bunch of
insertions and deletions we may end up with not much more than S<sub>0</sub> and end markers for higher levels.
That is no good.</p>
<a name="randomizing"></a>
<h2>Randomizing the Operations</h2>
<p>We don't change our search or deletion algorithms, but we do need to build some new towers when we
insert.  We do this by flipping a coin.  We always insert in S<sub>0</sub>.  We then flip a coin.  If it is heads
we insert into S<sub>1</sub> as well and flip another coin.  We continue inserting in the next level up until we
get a tail, and then stop.  DEMONSTRATE building a structure in class.<p>
<p>We no longer have the nice structure that we had before, but we are close.  </p>
<p>Could we end up with a really horrible structure?  Yes.  We could keep flipping heads for an
arbitrarily long time.  It is very unlikely, but it is possible.  Or we could keep getting tails and
end up with only S<sub>0</sub>, which would make searching O(n).  But in the expected case we have O(log n)
insertion, deletion, and searching.  And note that, unlike binary search trees, the run time does
not depend on the data.  It depends on coin flips.  So there are not good data sets and bad data
sets.  All data sets are equivalent.  There are good and bad series of coin tosses.  This is an 
example of a <em>randomized algorithm</em>.</p>
<p>The book notes that there are optimizations that can be made.  With a bit of care we can make
do with singly linked lists, because that is all we need for search and with a bit of extra effort
we can insert and delete on the way down.  Deletion is easy.  When you find the item on some level
just delete it on that level and on each subsequent level on the way down.  (You need to remember your
predecessor as well as your current in the list, or use a currentPred that points to the precessor of
the item that you think of as current, as we did in PS-2.)  Insertion is no harder.  
When you go to insert first
do the coin flips to see how high the tower will be, and then when you get to the appropriate level
begin inserting in each list as you go past it.</p>
<p>But what happens to the expected height, the expected run time, and the expected size?  It takes
some probability to see it, but they all end up being the same as in the non-randomized case!  The
book does these analyses, and has better typesetting capabilities than I am going to use in HTML
for rough class notes, so look there.  But here is the outline:

<h3>Expected height</h3>
<p>The height of the structure (number of lists) is expected to be 2 + log<sub>2</sub> n. I do the
exact analysis in a grad algorithms course in the section on randomized algorithms, but that takes
a bit more probability than we expect you to have.  But we do note that the probability of a particular
item appearing in list S<sub>k</sub> is 2<sup>-k</sup>.  That
is because to appear in list S<sub>k</sub> we need to have k successive heads, each of which has 
probability 1/2.  The probability that one of n items has height t is certainly no larger than 
n 2<sup>-k</sup> (by what is called the "union bound", which says that the probability of at least
one of a set of events occurring is at most the sum of the probabilities of each event occurring).  But 
in that case the probability that the height is greater than c log<sub>2</sub> n is at most
n 2<sup>-c log<sub>2</sub> n</sup> = n/n<sup>c</sup> = 1/n<sup>c-1</sup>.  So the probability that
the height is bigger than 5 log<sub>2</sub> n is no larger than 1/n<sup>4</sup>.<p>
<p>The book also notes that you can arbitrarily limit the height of the structure to something like 
max (10, 3 log<sub>2</sub> n) without messing up the analysis too much.  If you get that many heads
in a row you just stop flipping, so if you like you can
guarantee that the structure has height Θ(log n).</p>
<h3>Expected size</h3>
<p>The size is easier to analyze.  How many items do we expect on level S<sub>k</sub>?  We noted above that 
a given item appears on level k with probability 2<sup>-k</sup>, because we need to have k successive
heads to do this.  Let <em>x<sub>i,k</sub></em> be 1 if item i appears on level <em>k</em> and 0 otherwise.  Then the number of items that appear on level <em>k</em> is <em>x<sub>1,k</sub></em> + <em>x<sub>2,k</sub></em> + ... + <em>x<sub>n,k</sub></em>.  So the expected number of items on level <em>k</em> is 
<p>E(<em>x<sub>1,k</sub></em> + <em>x<sub>2,k</sub></em> + ... + <em>x<sub>n,k</sub></em>),</p> 
where E denotes the expected value (mean).  By a very powerful theorem called linearity of expectation we
know that the expectation (mean) of a sum is the sum of the expectations. Therefore 

<p>E(<em>x<sub>1,k</sub></em> + <em>x<sub>2,k</sub></em> + ... + <em>x<sub>n,k</sub></em>) = E(<em>x<sub>1,k</sub></em>) + E(<em>x<sub>2,k</sub></em>) + ... + E(<em>x<sub>n,k</sub></em>)</p>
<p>But E(<em>x<sub>i,k</sub></em>) = 2<sup>-k</sup>, because with this probability <em>x<sub>n,k</sub></em> is 1 and it is 0 otherwise.  This gives the expected number
of items in S<sub>k</sub> as n/2<sup>k</sup>, which is exactly the number of items that were in S<sub>k</sub> in the 
non-probabilistic version.  The sum of this quantitiy over the levels from 0 to infinity is 2n.
So the skip list is expected to take linear space.</p>
<p>The argument above will be much clearer after you take CS 30.  A substantial part of that course deals with probability.</p>
<h3>Expected number of comparisons per level</h3>
<p>What about the number of comparisons on a given level?  If we go past an item on level S<sub>k</sub> it is 
because the item was not promoted to S<sub>k+1</sub>.  (If it had been we would have passed it when
we saw it on that level, and would not be looking at it now.)  Therefore the coin flip when we inserted
it at this level must have been a tail, and the probability of passing by
an item without dropping down is 1/2.  The probability of dropping down is also 1/2.  
So we want to know the expected number of such items that we
will encounter on a given level.  This is the same as asking the number of times that we flip a coin
before we get a head, and that is 2, so the expected run time is 2 times the height.  
(In general the number of times that we expect to repeat an 
action before we "succeed" when the probability of success is p is 1/p.  So if you roll a die until
you get a 2 the probability of success is 1/6 and the expected number of rolls is 6. This is another fact covered in CS 30.)</p>
