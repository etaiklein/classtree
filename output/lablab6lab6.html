work with a partner, you will both get the same grade on the
assignment.

<p>

There will be no penalty, in terms of points, for working together on this assignment.  
Please make sure that <strong>both of you submit the code electronically</strong>.  
When you submit on Blackboard, be sure to state the name of your partner in the comments section.

<p>
You should weigh whether you will get more out of this assignment
working alone or with someone else.  The choice is up to you.

<p>

If you choose to work with someone else, pick your partner carefully.
Make sure that there are times that you are both available to work
together.  If you frequent the lab and you notice someone else who
often is there when you are, that person might be a good choice as
your partner.

<h2><a name="general"></a>General Instructions</h2>
<p><strong>Before you do anything</strong>, please read the entire
assignment <strong>carefully</strong>.  It contains suggestions
which can save you a lot of struggle later on.</p>
<h2><a name="bg"></a>Background on Connect 4</h2>
<p>Connect 4 is tic-tac-toe with gravity played on a board with 6
rows and 7 columns. As the name implies, the goal is to get 4 in a
row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).  The following is
an image of a Connect 4 board taken from Wikipedia:</p>
<img alt="Image of Connect4 Game Board" src="Connect4.jpg">
<p>Checkers are dropped at the top of a column and fall until they
reach the bottom or land on another checker.</p>
<p>An applet that lets you play against a Monte-Carlo implementation of the puzzle is on this
<a href="http://beej.us/blog/2010/01/monte-carlo-method-for-game-ai/">web page</a>.  However, 
your solution should generally beat this program.</p>
<p>You are to write a game-tree search program using alpha-beta pruning to play Connect 4.  The
Kalah program gives you the general outline of such a program.  I have provided three interfaces that
you should use: <a href="Connect4State.java">Connect4State</a>, 
<a href="Connect4View.java">Connect4View</a>, and 
<a href="Player.java">Player</a>.  These three files are combined in the zip file:
<a href="provided.zip">provided.zip</a>.</p>
<p>I have also provided you with a graphical user interface (and some other methods to be described
later) in the jar file <a href="Connect4.jar">Connect4.jar</a>. Download this file.  To add this file to your project:

<ol>
<li>Create a new project for your Connect 4 game.</li>
<li>Go into the Eclipse menu and select Preferences.  A window should open with General as a 
choice.  Click the triangle (or whatever) to expand the choices under General.  One of them 
is Workspace.  When you expand Workspace, one option is Linked Resources.  Click on this.  There
should be a check box labeled "Enable linked resources".  Check it if it is unchecked.</li>
<li>Click on your your project in the Package Explorer window on the left side
  (mine is called <code>Connect4</code>), go to the File menu, and select Properties.
  A window should open.</li>
<li>Click on "Java Build Path" in the list of choices on the left side of the window.</li>
<li>Click on "Libraries" in the choices along the top of the window.</li>
<li>Click on "Add External Jars..." and navigate to the file <code>Connect4.jar</code>.
  Select it and click "Open". The Jar file <code>Connect4.jar</code> should now be added to the build path.</li>
</ol>
<p>  Once you have done this you can create a <code>Connect4ViewGraphical</code> object 
for communication between your game and the world, using a default (no-parameter) constructor.  
(Playing it this way is a lot more fun that a text interface!)</p>
<p>One point about the graphical view: its <code>reportMove</code> puts the thread to sleep for a 
half a second.  This prevents moves from occurring so quickly that you can't see where they were
played.  However, this also means that funny things can happen if your program changes the state
that has been passed to the graphical view during that half second.  Checkers can appear and 
disappear and jump around.  If this happens make a copy of the state and pass that to the view,
so that it will not be changed.</p>
<h2><a name="progex"></a>Programming Exercises</h2>
<p>You should create the following classes, along with any other clases needed to implement them:</p>
<ul>
<li>A controller class to play the game, similar to <code>Kalah</code>.  I recommend using
      the trick of looking for substrings of names to pick which sort of Players should be created
      as the first and second player.</li>
<li>A model class that implements <a href="Connect4State.java">Connect4State</a> and
      holds information about the Connect4 game.  Note that this interface defines a number of 
      constants.  Use these in your program, particularly the ones that describe the characters
      representing checkers and and empty space, so that you can use <code>Connect4ViewGraphical</code>
      to display the game.  Note that your model class can include additional methods besides those
      required by the interface.</li>
<li>Two classes that extend the <code>Player</code> abstract class.  One should be a human player.
      The other should be a computer player that uses alpha-beta game tree search to pick moves.  
      Both should
      communicate with the world via a <a href="Connect4View.java">Connect4View</a>
      object that is created in your controller class.</li>
<li>A class that implements <a href="Connect4View.java">Connect4View</a> and provides
      interaction via text that is read from the keyboard and printed on the Console.</li>
</ul>
<p>These should allow you to play Connect4.</p>
<p>One of the challenging aspects of this project is to create a good static evaluation function.
For Kalah this was easy.  For Connect 4 it will require a bit more thought and programming.  Part of
your grade is coming up with a reasonably good static evaluation function.  Some things to consider
when planning your static evaluation function:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to win a Connect 4 game you have to get 4 checkers in a row.  Therefore the groups
  of 4 board squares in a row that are useful are the ones that do not contain at least one of
  each player's checkers.  (A 4-in-a-row that contains a checker belonging to each player cannot
  eventually be a winning 4-in-a-row.)  We will call such a set of 4 squares in a horizontal,
  vertical, or diagonal line an unblocked 4-in-a-row.
  So maybe your static evaluation function should look at unblocked 4-in-a-rows.</li>
<li>Having one checker in an unblocked 4-in-a-row is useful, but having 2 checkers in an unblocked
  4-in-a-row is better and having 3 checkers in an unblocked 4-in-a-row is a whole lot better.  One
  way to create a static evaluation function is to count unblocked 4-in-a-rows for each player,   
  weighted by the number of checkers in the 4-in-a-row.</li>
<li>Implementing the static evaluation function described above is sufficient for full credit for 
  the static evaluation function.  However, there are other things that you could consider.  Unblocked
  4-in-a-rows that contain 3 checkers and where there is no checker directly below the place where the
  fourth checker would go are threats.  Your opponent cannot immediately block this  4-in-a-row.  If
  the opponent runs out of other moves and is forced to play in the square below the missing checker 
  you can then complete the 4-in-a-row.  Some threats are more valuable than others.  Can you evaluate
  and incorporate threats into your  static evaluation function?  Extra credit for doing this or
  coming up with other ways to improve your static evaluation function.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Some things to be careful about</h3>
<ul>
<p>
<li>
The bottom row of the board is row 0 of the matrix.

<p>
<li>The first subscript is the row number and the second is the column number.
<p>
<li>
The move numbers returned by <code>getMove</code> are 0-6, not 1-7.
</li></p></li></p></li></p></ul>
<p>If you do not follow these conventions the graphical user interface will not work correctly.</p>
<h3>Testing</h3>
<p>You must test your static evaluation function separately.  If you just plug in
a static evaluation function into a game tree search and look ahead a bunch of moves
you will never know if it is working correctly or not. </p>
<p>The easiest way that I found to handle this was to write a small main program in
the <code>Connect4Game</code> class that created a game with two human players and a 
graphical or text view.  While the game is not over it gets and makes moves, displaying
the board and printing out the
value of the static evaluation function after each move.  Then you can compare the values
to what you get by doing the calculation by hand.</p>
<p>You can also test the static evaluation function in the context of the search.  
Search one or two levels deep, and print out the board and the value each time the 
static evaluation function is called. (Use your text view.)  This way
you can make sure that the game tree search is correctly picking the best move.  You can
also print the low and high values from alpha-beta pruning to see if that is working 
correctly.  </p>
<h3><a name="hier_in"></a>Test Runs to Turn In</h3>
<p>Include a test run that shows a game between your human player and your computer player using
your text view.  You should also include demonstrations of your error handling for things like entering
non-numbers or out of range numbers, etc.</p>
<p>Also include test runs that show that you have tested your static evaluation function and
it works correctly, and that the game tree search picks the correct move when looking ahead 2 moves.</p>
<h2><a name="ec"></a>Extra Credit</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Implement a player that uses Monte Carlo evaluation to pick its next move.</p>
<li><p>Implement a hybrid player that uses game tree search, but uses a Monte Carlo static evaluation
function.</p>
<li><p>Implement an especially nice static evaluation function and explain why it is good.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement improvements to speed up your alpha-beta search.  These can include things like choosing a better
order for considering moves. (Some EC for a fixed order that is better than left to right.  More 
extra credit for sorting by static evaluation.  Still more EC for ordering based on shallow search.)
<!-- We discussed other possiblilities in class. -->
<p></p></p></li>
<li><p>Implement improvements to speed up your static evaluation and search code.  Examples: A move in Kalah
often changes most of the board, and the board was small.  Therefore creating a new state for each
recursive call was a reasonable choice.  However, in Connect 4 the board is larger and a move changes 
very little, and it is easy to write an undoMove method.  Therefore it is possible to make and undo 
moves and have only one
game state in your game tree search that gets modified as you go down into and come back out of deeper levels.</p></li>
<li><p>The jar file also includes my version of a computer player.  The class is <code>ComputerPlayerABPlus</code>,
and its contructor has two parameters: a <code>String</code> name and an <code>int</code> desired look-ahead depth.  
Therefore you can play your game tree search player (or Monte Carlo player or hybrid player) against mine.  
You might find it interesting to play against it as a human player.
Substantial extra
credit (plus bragging rights) if your player beats mine when mine is playing with 16 lookahead.  For full credit
it should win as both the first and the second player.
To be fair your program has to take about the same amount of time that mine does - the slowest moves
take about 30 seconds on my Macbook Pro, and an entire game with the program playing itself takes just over
5 minutes.  You can also try it on levels 14 and 12, which are much faster.  Because of the horizon effect 
my player tends to play very 
defensively on odd depths, where the opponent has the last move.</p></li>
<li><p>Implement your own version of a graphical view.</p></li>
</li></li></ul>
<h2><a name="turnin"></a>Canvas submission</h2>
<p>Submit electronically via Canvas the zip file of a folder that contains:</p>
<ol>
<li>all the java files needed to run your program, and </li>
<li>the text produced by the test runs described above.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you choose to do the extra credit, include those java files and text produced by their test runs also,
but keep the extra credit files in a separate zip file from the regular ones so that any errors in your extra credit work
will not affect your grade for the regular assignment.  If some classes are used by
both the regular assignment and the extra credit, include a separate copie in each zip file.</p>
<p>
If you work with a partner, please make sure that <strong>each of you submits via Canvas</strong>
and be sure to state the name of your partner in the comments section.
